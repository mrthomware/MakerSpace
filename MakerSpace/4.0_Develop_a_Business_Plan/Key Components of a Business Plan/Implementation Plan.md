# Implementation Plan

Our implementation plan outlines the steps we will take to launch our Maker Space, as well as our goals, objectives, and measures of success.

## 1. Steps and Timelines

- **Securing Funding (Month 1-2):** Our first step is to secure the necessary funding for our startup costs. This will involve finalizing our business plan, meeting with potential investors, and exploring grant opportunities.

- **Securing a Location (Month 2-3):** Once we have secured funding, we will find a suitable location for our Maker Space. We will need a space that is large enough to accommodate our equipment and workspaces, and that is easily accessible to our members.

- **Purchasing Equipment and Setting Up the Space (Month 3-4):** After securing a location, we will purchase our equipment and set up our Maker Space. This will involve setting up our workspaces, installing our equipment, and ensuring all safety protocols are in place.

- **Hiring Staff (Month 4-5):** We will hire our staff, including an Operations Coordinator, Education Coordinator, and Marketing Coordinator. We will also recruit volunteers to help with workshops and events.

- **Marketing and Promotion (Month 5-6):** We will begin marketing and promoting our Maker Space, including launching our website, setting up our social media profiles, and hosting a grand opening event.

- **Opening (Month 6):** We will officially open our Maker Space to members. We will begin offering workshops and classes, and we will continue to promote our services and attract new members.

## 2. Goals and Objectives

- **Attract 100 members in the first year.**
- **Develop and offer 10 different workshops or classes within the first six months.**
- **Increase our membership by 20% in the second year.**
- **Achieve a positive cash flow and a profit margin of approximately 10.7% in the first year.**

## 3. Measures of Success

We will measure our success based on the following metrics:

- **Number of Members:** Our primary measure of success will be the number of members we attract.
- **Workshop and Class Attendance:** We will also measure the number of participants in our workshops and classes.
- **Member Satisfaction:** We will regularly seek feedback from our members to measure their satisfaction and identify areas for improvement.
- **Financial Performance:** We will track our revenue, expenses, and profit margin to measure our financial performance.

Our implementation plan provides a clear roadmap for launching our Maker Space and achieving our goals. By following this plan, we can ensure that we are making progress and staying on track.

 This Implementation Plan provides a step-by-step plan for launching the Maker Space, including timelines and milestones. It also outlines the business's goals and objectives and how it plans to measure its progress.
