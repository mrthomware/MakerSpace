However, we also aim to attract younger members through partnerships with local schools and youth organizations.

In addition, there is a growing interest in entrepreneurship and innovation, with more individuals looking to start their own businesses or develop their own products. Maker Spaces, with their access to tools and resources, can play a key role in supporting these entrepreneurial endeavors.

## Competitive Analysis
