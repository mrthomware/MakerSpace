# Financial Projections and Funding for a Maker Space

## 1. Financial Projections:

### Revenue Projections:

- **Memberships:** If we attract 100 members paying an average of $50 per month, we will generate $60,000 in annual membership revenue.
- **Workshops and Classes:** If we offer 10 workshops per month with an average of 10 participants paying $20 each, we will generate $24,000 in annual workshop revenue.
- **Equipment Rental:** If we generate an additional $500 per month in equipment rental fees, this will add $6,000 to our annual revenue.

This gives us a total projected annual revenue of $90,000.

### Expense Projections:

- **Rent:** If we pay $2,000 per month in rent, our annual rent expense will be $24,000.
- **Utilities and Maintenance:** If we spend an average of $500 per month on utilities and maintenance, our annual expense for this will be $6,000.
- **Salaries:** If we pay an average of $3,000 per month in salaries, our annual salary expense will be $36,000.
- **Equipment and Supplies:** If we spend an average of $1,000 per month on equipment and supplies, our annual expense for this will be $12,000.
- **Marketing:** If we spend an average of $200 per month on marketing, our annual marketing expense will be $2,400.

This gives us a total projected annual expense of $80,400.

Based on these projections, we would have a profit margin of approximately 10.7% and a positive cash flow.

## 2. Funding:

At this stage, we estimate that we will need approximately $50,000 in startup capital to cover the initial rent, equipment purchases, and marketing efforts. We plan to secure this funding through a combination of owner investment, business loans, and potentially grants or sponsorships.

Please note that these are rough estimates and the actual numbers will depend on a variety of factors, including the specific costs in your area, the number of members you attract, and the prices you charge for memberships and workshops.
