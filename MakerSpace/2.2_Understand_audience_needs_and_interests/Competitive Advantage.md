# Competitive Advantage

Understanding and meeting the needs and interests of your audience can give you a competitive advantage. By consistently delivering value and meeting their expectations, you position your Maker Space as a trusted and preferred choice.

For a Maker Space, this could involve:

- Offering tools, equipment, and resources that your audience needs and values.
- Providing workshops or events that cater to your audience's interests.
- Creating a supportive and inclusive environment that meets your audience's expectations.

By doing so, you not only attract and retain members, but also differentiate your Maker Space from others, gaining a competitive edge.
