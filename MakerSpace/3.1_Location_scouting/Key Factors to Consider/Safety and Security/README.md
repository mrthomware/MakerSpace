# Importance of Safety and Security in Location Scouting for a Maker Space

## Safety Measures
- **Emergency Preparedness**: Does the location have necessary safety measures such as fire exits and first aid kits? In case of an emergency, it's important that members can evacuate quickly and safely.
- **Safe Storage**: Does the location provide safe storage for potentially dangerous tools? Tools should be stored securely to prevent accidents.

## Security
- **Security Measures**: Does the location have security measures such as locks, alarms, or security cameras? These measures can help protect your Maker Space and its equipment from theft or vandalism.
- **Access Control**: Consider how you will control access to the Maker Space. Will you use keys, access cards, or a digital access system? The location should support your chosen access control method.

By considering safety and security during location scouting, you can ensure that you choose a location that is not only suitable and visually appealing for your Maker Space but also safe and secure for your members and equipment.
