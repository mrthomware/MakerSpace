# Importance of Aesthetics in Location Scouting for a Maker Space

## Creative Inspiration
- **Inspiring Environment**: The aesthetics of the location should inspire creativity. Does the location have a look and feel that stimulates creative thinking and collaboration among your members? Consider factors such as color, design, and overall vibe of the space.
- **Stimulating Surroundings**: The surroundings of the location can also contribute to creative inspiration. A location with interesting architectural features, natural elements, or unique design elements can stimulate creative thinking.

## Alignment with Maker Space Aesthetics
- **Natural Light**: Does the location have plenty of natural light? Natural light can create a more welcoming and inspiring environment.
- **Open Spaces**: Open spaces can encourage collaboration and make the space feel more inclusive. They can also provide flexibility for different activities and events.
- **Layout**: The layout of the location should encourage collaboration. It should allow for easy movement and interaction among members. It should also provide spaces for different types of activities, such as group projects, individual work, and presentations or demonstrations.

By considering aesthetics during location scouting, you can ensure that you choose a location that not only meets your practical requirements but also creates an inspiring and enjoyable environment for your members.
