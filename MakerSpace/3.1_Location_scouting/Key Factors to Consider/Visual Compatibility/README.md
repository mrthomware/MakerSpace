## Aesthetics
- **Creative Inspiration**: The aesthetics of the location should inspire creativity. Does the location have a look and feel that stimulates creative thinking and collaboration among your members?
- **Alignment with Maker Space Aesthetics**: Does the location align with the desired aesthetics of your Maker Space? Consider factors such as natural light, open spaces, and a layout that encourages collaboration.

## Themes
- **Support for Maker Space Themes**: Does the location support the themes of your Maker Space, such as technology, science, and art? The location should visually represent these themes and inspire members to explore these areas.

## Ambiance
- **Welcoming Environment**: The ambiance of the location is crucial. It should be welcoming and inclusive, making members feel comfortable and motivated to participate in Maker Space activities.
- **Collaborative Atmosphere**: The location should also foster a collaborative atmosphere. It should encourage members to share ideas, work together on projects, and learn from each other.

By considering visual compatibility during location scouting, you can ensure that you choose a location that not only meets your practical requirements but also creates an inspiring and enjoyable environment for your members.
