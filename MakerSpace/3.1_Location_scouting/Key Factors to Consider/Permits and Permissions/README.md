# Importance of Permits and Permissions in Location Scouting for a Maker Space

## Usage Permissions
- **Permission to Operate**: Do you have permission to use the location as a Maker Space? This could involve getting permission from the property owner or the local government.
- **Activity Restrictions**: Are there any restrictions on the type of activities or the number of people allowed? Some locations may have restrictions that could limit the operations of your Maker Space.

## Building Codes
- **Safety Compliance**: Does the location comply with local building codes, especially for safety and accessibility? This could include fire safety regulations, accessibility requirements for people with disabilities, and more.
- **Renovation Permissions**: If you plan to make any changes to the location, such as installing new equipment or modifying the layout, you may need additional permits. 

By considering permits and permissions during location scouting, you can ensure that you choose a location that is not only suitable and visually appealing for your Maker Space but also legally compliant.
