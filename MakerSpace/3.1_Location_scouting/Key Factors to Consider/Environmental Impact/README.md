# Importance of Environmental Impact in Location Scouting for a Maker Space

## Sustainability
- **Sustainable Practices**: Does the use of the location align with sustainability principles? Consider factors such as energy efficiency, water usage, and the environmental impact of any renovations you plan to make.
- **Conservation Requirements**: Are there any conservation requirements to consider? Some locations may have restrictions to protect local ecosystems or historical features.

## Waste Management
- **Waste Facilities**: Does the location have facilities for managing waste, especially for potentially hazardous materials used in making activities? Proper waste management is crucial for the safety of your members and the environment.
- **Recycling**: Consider how you will handle recycling at your Maker Space. Does the location support your recycling needs?

By considering environmental impact during location scouting, you can ensure that you choose a location that is not only suitable and visually appealing for your Maker Space but also environmentally responsible.
