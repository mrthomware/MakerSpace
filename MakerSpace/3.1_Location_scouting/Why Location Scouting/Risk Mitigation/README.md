# Importance of Risk Mitigation in Location Scouting for a Maker Space

## Identify Potential Risks
- **Risk Identification**: Through scouting, you can identify potential risks or challenges associated with a location. This could include issues with accessibility, safety hazards, or potential disruptions like noise from nearby construction.
- **Proactive Problem-Solving**: Identifying these risks allows you to proactively address issues. You can come up with solutions or contingency plans to mitigate these risks, ensuring smooth operations of your Maker Space.

## Safety Planning
- **Safety Assessment**: Risk assessment during scouting can also help in planning safety measures for your Maker Space. This could include identifying potential hazards and planning for necessary safety equipment or procedures.
- **Emergency Planning**: As part of safety planning, consider emergency situations. Is there easy access for emergency vehicles? Are there clear evacuation routes? Is there a nearby hospital or clinic?

By considering risk mitigation during location scouting, you can ensure that you choose a location that is not only suitable and compliant for your Maker Space but also safe for your members and staff.
