# Guidance for Location Scouting for a Maker Space

## Define Your Requirements
- **Specific Requirements**: Clearly define the specific requirements you are seeking in a location. This could include the size, layout, and any specific facilities needed for your Maker Space.
- **Aesthetics and Ambiance**: Consider the aesthetics and ambiance you want for your Maker Space. This could influence the types of locations you consider.

## Research Potential Locations
- **Online Resources**: Utilize online resources, location databases, or local contacts to identify potential locations that align with your requirements.
- **Recommendations**: Consider reaching out to other Maker Space operators for recommendations. They may have valuable insights to share.

## Visit and Assess Locations
- **In-Person Visits**: Visit each potential location in person to evaluate its suitability. Assess factors such as the available space, lighting conditions, and any potential challenges.
- **Trial Runs**: If possible, consider doing a trial run at each location. This could involve setting up some equipment and seeing how it works in the space.

## Document and Compare
- **Documentation**: Document details, take photographs, or create sketches to help compare and evaluate each location effectively.
- **Comparison**: Consider the pros and cons of each location in relation to your Maker Space's requirements. This could include factors such as cost, location, facilities, and potential for growth.

## Communicate and Collaborate
- **Team Engagement**: Engage with your team or stakeholders during the scouting process. Share insights, gather input, and consider different perspectives to make informed decisions.
- **Community Engagement**: Consider involving your future Maker Space community in the decision-making process. Their input could be invaluable in choosing the right location.

By following this guidance, you can conduct effective location scouting and choose the best location for your Maker Space.
