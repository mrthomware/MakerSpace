# Documenting and Comparing Potential Locations for a Maker Space

## Document Details
For each location visited, document the following details:
- **Address**: The exact location of the space.
- **Size**: The total area of the space in square feet or meters.
- **Layout**: The layout of the space, including the number and type of rooms.
- **Facilities**: The facilities available, such as restrooms, kitchen, lounge area, etc.
- **Accessibility**: The accessibility of the location, including public transportation, parking availability, etc.
- **Cost**: The cost of renting the space, including any additional costs such as utilities or maintenance.

## Take Photographs
Take photographs of each location to help visualize the space. Include photographs of:
- **Exterior**: The outside of the building, including the entrance and parking area.
- **Interior**: The inside of the space, including different rooms and facilities.
- **Features**: Any unique or notable features of the space.

## Create Sketches
Create sketches of the layout of each location. This can help visualize how the space could be arranged and used for your Maker Space.

## Compare Locations
After documenting each location, compare them based on the following factors:
- **Suitability**: How well does the location meet your specific requirements?
- **Cost**: How does the cost of each location compare? Consider both the rental cost and any additional costs.
- **Pros and Cons**: What are the advantages and disadvantages of each location? Consider factors such as size, layout, facilities, accessibility, and cost.

By documenting and comparing each location, you can make an informed decision about the best location for your Maker Space.
