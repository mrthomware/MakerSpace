# Importance of Compliance and Permissions in Location Scouting for a Maker Space

## Legal Compliance
- **Regulatory Requirements**: Scouting enables you to identify any legal or regulatory requirements associated with specific locations. This could include zoning laws, building codes, or health and safety regulations.
- **Permits and Permissions**: During scouting, you can also identify any permits or permissions required to operate a Maker Space at each location. This could include building permits, business licenses, or permissions from the property owner.
- **Compliance Assurance**: By identifying these requirements during scouting, you can ensure compliance before you commit to a location. This can help you avoid potential legal issues down the line.

## Smooth Operations
- **Prevent Legal Hassles**: Ensuring compliance and permissions beforehand can ensure smooth operations of your Maker Space without any legal hassles. You won't have to worry about being shut down or fined due to non-compliance.
- **Peace of Mind**: Knowing that your Maker Space is fully compliant with all legal and regulatory requirements can give you peace of mind. You can focus on running your Maker Space, rather than worrying about potential legal issues.

By considering compliance and permissions during location scouting, you can ensure that you choose a location that is not only suitable and cost-effective for your Maker Space but also legally compliant.
