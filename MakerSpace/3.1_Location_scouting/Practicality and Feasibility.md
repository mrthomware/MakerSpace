# Importance of Logistical Considerations in Location Scouting for a Maker Space

## Practicality and Feasibility
- **Accessibility**: Scouting helps you evaluate the accessibility of a location. It's important that your Maker Space is easily accessible to your target audience. Consider factors such as public transportation, parking availability, and proximity to your audience's common areas.
- **Facilities**: Assess the available facilities at each location. Does the location have necessary facilities such as restrooms, a kitchen or snack area, and possibly a lounge or relaxation area?
- **Power Supply and Internet Connectivity**: Check the power supply and internet connectivity at each location. Your Maker Space will likely require a reliable and sufficient power supply for various equipment, as well as a strong and fast internet connection.

## Optimal Space Utilization
- **Space Planning**: By evaluating the space during scouting, you can plan for optimal utilization of the space for various activities in your Maker Space. Consider how the space can be arranged for different activities, including workspaces, storage areas, and display areas for completed projects.
- **Flexibility**: Consider the flexibility of the space. Can it be rearranged for different activities? Is there room for your Maker Space to grow and evolve?

By considering these logistical factors during location scouting, you can ensure that you choose a location that is not only visually appealing but also practical and feasible for your Maker Space.
