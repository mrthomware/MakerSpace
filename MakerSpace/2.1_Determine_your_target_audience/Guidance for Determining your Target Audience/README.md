## Guidance for Determining Your Target Audience

To determine your target audience effectively, consider the following guidance:

1. **Market Research**: Conduct thorough market research to gain insights into the demographics, psychographics, and behaviors of potential customers. Utilize surveys, interviews, focus groups, and existing market data. For a Maker Space, this could involve researching the maker community, conducting surveys or interviews with potential members, or analyzing data from existing Maker Spaces.

2. **Analyze Existing Customers**: Analyze the characteristics, preferences, and behaviors of your existing customer base. Identify common traits and patterns to inform your target audience definition. For a Maker Space, this could involve analyzing your current members' interests, skills, usage patterns, and feedback.

3. **Segmentation**: Segment your audience based on relevant criteria such as age, gender, location, interests, making behavior, or skill levels. This helps create distinct audience profiles and tailor your strategies accordingly.

4. **Develop Personas**: Create detailed personas that represent different segments of your target audience. Personas include information like demographics, interests, goals, challenges, and making behavior. For a Maker Space, this could involve creating personas such as "The Tech Enthusiast", "The Artistic Maker", or "The DIY Hobbyist".

5. **Test and Refine**: Continuously test and refine your understanding of your target audience. Seek feedback, monitor market trends, and adjust your strategies based on insights gained. For a Maker Space, this could involve regularly seeking member feedback, staying updated on maker trends, and adapting your offerings based on your members' evolving needs and interests.
