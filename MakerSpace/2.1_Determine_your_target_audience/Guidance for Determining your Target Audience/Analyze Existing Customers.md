# Analyzing Existing Customers

Existing customers or members of a Maker Space can provide valuable insights into your target audience. Here are some aspects to consider:

## Interests and Skills
Analyze the types of projects your members work on and the skills they use. This can give you an idea of their interests and technical abilities. For example, are they more interested in digital fabrication, electronics, woodworking, or other areas?

## Usage Patterns
Look at when and how often your members use the Maker Space. Do they come in regularly, or only for specific projects? Do they prefer to work alone or in groups? This can help you understand their habits and preferences.

## Feedback
Consider any feedback you've received from your members. What do they like about the Maker Space? What do they think could be improved? This can help you understand their needs and expectations.

## Demographics
Consider the demographic characteristics of your members. This could include factors like age, gender, occupation, and education level. This information can help you understand who is currently using your Maker Space and who might be interested in the future.

Remember, every Maker Space is unique, so it's important to gather and analyze data from your own members to understand your specific audience.
