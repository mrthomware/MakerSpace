# Summary

1. **Who might use the space?** Understand your audience. The space could be used by people of all ages, or it might be more popular with younger patrons. Knowing your audience helps tailor the use of the space.

2. **How will it be used?** Consider the types of activities you envision in the space. Inviting potential users to give feedback on their interests through surveys or focus groups can help refine your vision and ensure you are creating a space that meets their needs.

3. **Where should the space be located?** The location of the makerspace in the building can greatly impact its usage. Factors to consider include noise from equipment and accessibility to all patrons.

4. **How will we staff the space?** The size and location of the space may be influenced by staffing availability and expertise. If there will be dedicated staff, the makerspace can be large and fully equipped.

5. **What will be our storage needs?** Determine what equipment will be needed and assess storage needs accordingly. Consider both enclosed storage for items not meant to be seen or used at all times and visible storage so that patrons can see everything that is available for them to use.

6. **What will be our mechanical and electrical needs?** Some types of equipment, like laser cutters and 3-D printers, need additional ventilation beyond a typical meeting room environment. Also, ensure there are plenty of outlets along the counters, walls, and floor.

7. **What will we need for staff space?** If someone is going to be staffing the space, then a service desk or an office directly adjacent to the space may be needed.

8. **What will be our display and AV needs?** Some space should be dedicated for display. A large monitor or a projection screen can be used for programs or for instructional display within the space.

9. **What will we need for enclosures and flooring?** Makerspaces are typically completely enclosed, although not in all cases. The enclosure could be an all-glass system, and if desired, it could be a retractable wall to create an open, inviting area within the library when it’s not being used as an instructional space. 

10. **What will we need for furniture?** The furniture provides the flexibility, functionality, aesthetic and the user experience in the space. Consider flexible design and furniture that allows for easy reconfiguration of the space.
