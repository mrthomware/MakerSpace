Segmentation of a Maker Space audience can be based on various factors. Here are some insights gathered from the Maker Movement:

1. **Demographics**: The Maker Movement has spread to more than 30 countries around the world, with over 1.1 million visitors at the most recent event. The study also revealed that more than half of self-proclaimed makers are Millennials.

2. **Interests**: The Maker Movement is driven by economic, societal, and technological forces. Makers are empowered by alternative ways to engage in the economy, person-to-person interactions for social reform, and access to simplified design tools and cost-effective DIY kits.

3. **Behaviors**: Makers are part of a culture of resource-sharing and a can-do spirit. They are part of an inclusive and collaborative environment that fosters communication and connection in society.

4. **Communication Preferences**: Makers are part of online communities and social media networks. Websites pivotal to the maker movement, like Instructables.com, have helped digitize manufacturing and contributed to the growth of the online marketplace for makers.

5. **Needs and Challenges**: Makers are driven by the ease at which designs for physical things can be shared digitally. They are part of a movement that promotes entrepreneurship and innovation for economic growth, brings distributed manufacturing technologies to companies and individuals, and helps start businesses and create jobs for the workforce.

Remember, the success of a commercial Maker Space relies on a suitable and sustainable business plan. Before deciding to start a Maker Space, one should consider a number of essential questions which could potentially affect the decision-making, risks, and projections of the business.
