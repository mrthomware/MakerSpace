Chapter 5: Programming and Workshops

## 5.1 Planning Workshops and Classes

Planning workshops and classes is an important aspect of running a successful maker space. Consider the following steps when developing your program schedule:

- Identify Topics: Determine the topics and themes that align with your objectives and target audience's interests. Consider a mix of introductory, intermediate, and advanced topics to cater to different skill levels.

- Define Learning Outcomes: Clearly define the learning outcomes you want participants to achieve through each workshop or class. Set specific goals and objectives to guide the development of the curriculum and activities.

- Sequencing and Progression: Plan a sequence of workshops or classes that build upon each other, allowing participants to progress and develop their skills. Ensure a logical flow and consider prerequisites, if necessary.

- Duration and Frequency: Determine the duration and frequency of each workshop or class based on the complexity of the topic and the availability of resources. Consider offering both shorter sessions and longer immersive workshops to accommodate different schedules and learning preferences.

- Resources and Materials: Identify the resources, materials, and tools required for each workshop or class. Ensure that you have the necessary equipment, supplies, and access to technology to facilitate hands-on learning experiences.

## 5.2 Collaborating with Instructors and Experts

Collaborating with instructors and experts can enhance the quality and diversity of your programming. Consider the following strategies:

- In-house Experts: Identify individuals within your organization or community who have expertise in specific areas related to making. Encourage them to lead workshops or classes and share their knowledge with participants.

- Guest Instructors: Invite guest instructors who have specialized skills or knowledge to conduct workshops or give lectures. Reach out to professionals, industry experts, artists, or educators who can provide unique perspectives and insights.

- Partnership with Educational Institutions: Collaborate with local schools, colleges, or universities to establish partnerships and access their pool of instructors or experts. Offer your maker space as a venue for their workshops or classes, fostering community engagement.

- Professional Networks: Connect with professional networks and organizations relevant to your maker space's focus areas. Engage their members as instructors or invite them to deliver presentations or demonstrations.

## 5.3 Developing a Diverse Program Schedule

Developing a diverse program schedule ensures that your maker space caters to a wide range of interests and participants. Consider the following strategies:

- Skill Areas: Offer workshops and classes that cover various skill areas, such as electronics, woodworking, coding, 3D printing, textile arts, or robotics. Provide opportunities for participants to explore different disciplines and discover new interests.

- Age and Experience Levels: Tailor your program schedule to accommodate participants of different ages and experience levels. Offer workshops specifically designed for children, teens, adults, beginners, and advanced learners.

- Interdisciplinary Collaboration: Encourage interdisciplinary collaboration by organizing workshops or projects that integrate multiple skill areas. For example, combine electronics and art to create interactive installations or merge coding and woodworking to build smart furniture.

- Special Events and Challenges: Organize special events, challenges, or hackathons to foster creativity, innovation, and collaboration. These events can be themed, time-limited, or competitive, providing unique experiences for participants.

- Feedback and Evaluation: Regularly gather feedback from participants to assess their satisfaction and preferences. Use this feedback to refine and diversify your program schedule based on their interests and suggestions.

By carefully planning workshops and classes, collaborating with instructors and experts, and developing a diverse program schedule, you can provide engaging and enriching experiences for participants in your maker space.
