# Demographics of Maker Spaces

Here is a summary of the demographics of Maker Spaces based on the information from the Lakehead University Library:

Maker Spaces are collaborative workspaces inside schools, libraries, or separate public/private facilities for making, learning, exploring, and sharing. They use a range of tools from high tech to no tech. These spaces are open to kids, adults, and entrepreneurs and have a variety of maker equipment including 3D printers, laser cutters, CNC machines, soldering irons, and even sewing machines. However, a makerspace doesnâ€™t need to include all of these machines or even any of them to be considered a makerspace. If you have cardboard, legos, and art supplies, you're in business. It's more about the maker mindset of creating something out of nothing and exploring your own interests that's at the core of a makerspace.

These spaces are also helping to prepare those who need the critical 21st-century skills in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM). They provide hands-on learning, help with critical thinking skills, and even boost self-confidence. Some of the skills that are learned in a makerspace pertain to electronics, 3D printing, 3D modeling, coding, robotics, and even woodworking. Makerspaces are also fostering entrepreneurship and are being utilized as incubators and accelerators for business startups.
