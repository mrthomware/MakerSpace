### Needs and Challenges of Maker Space Users

1. **Cost**: Establishing and maintaining a Maker Space can involve significant costs. This includes the initial purchase of equipment, ongoing maintenance, replacement components, and consumable materials that require replenishing. Funding for these costs can come from a variety of sources, including grants, school budgets, foundational funding, and "friends of the library" groups. However, future funding must also be considered to keep a Maker Space running.

2. **Staffing and Scheduling**: Sufficiently staffing a Maker Space and providing programming can be challenging. Staff may need to balance managing both a library and a Maker Space, and scheduling activities and open "making time" can pose challenges.

3. **Staff and Patron Training**: Both librarian and patron training are necessary aspects of library Maker Spaces, yet these training opportunities are not always readily accessible. Staff may need to obtain training, keep abreast of new technologies and trends, and develop a professional learning network. Patrons also need training to ensure that equipment is accessed properly and safely.

4. **Neatness, Noise, and Maintenance**: Maker Spaces can invite "creative mess" and potentially damage existing furnishings. Noise from certain equipment may require added noise reduction features. The responsibility for the upkeep of the space, ensuring order, tidiness, and damage control, needs to be addressed.

5. **Safety and Liability**: Patron safety becomes a primary consideration when Maker Spaces provide potentially hazardous equipment. Safety protocols and user agreements are necessary to ensure safe conditions and protect the institution from liability.

6. **Copyright and Intellectual Property**: Issues such as copyright infringement, liability, and intellectual property can arise with the use of rapid prototyping such as 3D printing in Maker Spaces. Policies may need to be in place to ensure that patrons respect copyright law when creating products in the Maker Space.

7. **Resistance to Change**: Resistance to change can be a challenge when introducing a Maker Space. Staff and patrons may be hesitant to accept new directions in library programming. Effective change-management models and community support can help address this resistance.
