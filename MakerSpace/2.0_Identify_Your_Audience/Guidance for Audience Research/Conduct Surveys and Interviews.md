4. What times of day would you be most likely to use the Maker Space?
5. What types of workshops or events would you be interested in attending?
6. What is your preferred method of learning new skills? (e.g., self-guided, workshops, one-on-one instruction)
7. What motivates you to use a Maker Space? (e.g., learning new skills, working on personal projects, collaborating with others)

## Interview Questions

1. Can you tell me about a project you've worked on or would like to work on in a Maker Space?
2. What tools or equipment have you used or would like to use in a Maker Space?
