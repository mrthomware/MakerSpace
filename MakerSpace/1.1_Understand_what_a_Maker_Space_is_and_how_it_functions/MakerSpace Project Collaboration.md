# MakerSpace Project Collaboration

## Overview

Our Maker Space encourages collaboration among members. This document provides guidelines for project collaboration within our community.

## Starting a Collaborative Project

1. **Project Proposal:** If you have an idea for a collaborative project, submit a project proposal to the Maker Space management. The proposal should include a project description, objectives, required resources, and estimated timeline.

2. **Team Formation:** Once your project is approved, you can invite other members to join your team. You can also post a call for collaborators on our community board.

## Working on a Collaborative Project

1. **Project Management:** Assign roles and responsibilities within your team. Establish a project timeline and set regular meetings to track progress.

2. **Resource Allocation:** Coordinate with the Maker Space management for resource allocation. Ensure that your project activities do not disrupt the regular operations of the Maker Space.

3. **Knowledge Sharing:** Encourage knowledge sharing within your team. If a team member learns a new skill or technique, they should share it with the rest of the team.

## Completing a Collaborative Project

1. **Project Completion:** Upon completion of the project, submit a final report to the Maker Space management. The report should include project outcomes, challenges faced, and lessons learned.

2. **Project Showcase:** We encourage teams to showcase their completed projects. You can organize a demonstration or presentation for other Maker Space members.

## Conclusion

Collaborative projects are a great way to learn new skills, solve complex problems, and build a sense of community. We look forward to seeing what you create together!
