# Applications of Makerspaces  

Makerspaces are collaborative workspaces inside a school, library, or separate public/private facility for making, learning, exploring, and sharing that uses high tech to no tech tools. They are open to kids, adults, and entrepreneurs and have a variety of maker equipment including 3D printers, laser cutters, CNC machines, soldering irons, and even sewing machines. However, a makerspace doesnâ€™t need to include all of these machines or even any of them to be considered a makerspace. If you have cardboard, Legos, and art supplies, you're in business.  

The core of a makerspace is the maker mindset of creating something out of nothing and exploring your own interests. These spaces are also helping to prepare those who need the critical 21st-century skills in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM). They provide hands-on learning, help with critical thinking skills, and even boost self-confidence. Some of the skills that are learned in a makerspace pertain to electronics, 3D printing, 3D modeling, coding, robotics, and even woodworking.  

Makerspaces are also fostering entrepreneurship and are being utilized as incubators and accelerators for business startups. There have already been some amazing success stories that have come out of makerspaces to date. 

Here are just some of the things you can do in a makerspace:   

Coding  
3D printing  
Laser cutting  
Soldering  
Electronics / Arduino  
Robot building / Robotics  
Learn Circuits and Electricity with paper circuits  
Sewing  
Woodworking  
Take-a-part sessions  
Inventing  
Makerspaces are not only a place where you can make stuff but many times it's a place where you make "meaning" which many times is more important than the stuff you make.  

In conclusion, Makerspaces are zones of self-directed learning. Their hands-on character, coupled with the tools and raw materials that support invention, provide the ultimate workshop for the tinkerer and the perfect  
educational space for individuals who learn best by doing. They promote multidisciplinary thinking and learning, enriching the projects that are built there and the value of the makerspace as an educational venue.
