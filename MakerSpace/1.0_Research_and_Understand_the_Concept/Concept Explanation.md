#Concept Explanation

A Makerspace, also known as a hackerspace, hacklab, or hackspace, is a community-operated workspace where individuals with common interests, such as computers, machining, technology, science, digital art, or electronic art, can meet, socialize, and collaborate. These spaces are often not-for-profit and are comparable to other community-operated spaces with similar aims and mechanisms such as Fab Lab, men's sheds, and commercial "for-profit" companies.

## History

The concept of Makerspaces has been around since 2006, with the establishment of Metalab in Vienna, Austria. The advent of crowdfunding and platforms like Kickstarter has made it easier to establish these spaces. The number of Makerspaces has grown significantly over the years, with a significant increase from 2006 to 2016. The US federal government has also adopted the concept of Makerspaces within its agencies.

## Activities

Makerspaces function as centers for peer learning and knowledge sharing, in the form of workshops, presentations, and lectures. They also offer social activities for their members, such as game nights and parties. Many Makerspaces participate in the use and development of free software, open hardware, and alternative media.

## Facilities

The specific tools and resources available at Makerspaces vary from place to place. They typically provide space for members to work on their individual projects, or to collaborate on group projects with other members. The building or facility the Makerspace occupies provides physical infrastructure that members need to complete their projects. In addition to space, most Makerspaces provide electrical power, computer servers, and networking with Internet connectivity.

## Organization

The individual character of a Makerspace is determined by its members. Some Makerspaces are governed by elected boards selected by active members in good standing. Others are led by a single Benevolent Dictator For Life (BDFL). Membership fees are usually the main income of a Makerspace, but some also accept external sponsors.

## Ethic

Makerspaces generally follow a “hacker ethic”, which includes freedom, in the sense of autonomy as well as of free access and circulation of information; distrust of authority, opposing the traditional, industrial top-down style of organization; embracing the concept of learning by doing and peer-to-peer learning processes as opposed to formal modes of learning; sharing, solidarity, and cooperation.

Equity and justice-centered making

Makerspaces potentially offer opportunities for young people to engage in STEM knowledge and practices in creative and playful ways. However, an explicit equity-agenda has been fairly absent in the maker movement, especially as it relates to sustained engagement in making. The movement remains an adult, white, middle-class pursuit, led by those with the leisure time, technical knowledge, experience, and resources to make.

## Difficulties and critique

Makerspaces can run into difficulties with building codes or other planning regulations, which may not be designed to handle their scope of activities. The difficulties with opening Makerspaces and Makerspaces within non-profit organizations, such as schools and public libraries include cost, space, liability, and availability of personnel. Many Makerspaces struggle to sustain viable business models in support of their missions.

#Variations

There are many variations of Makerspaces, including public library Makerspaces, feminist Makerspaces, public school maker/hackerspaces, Fab labs, community spaces, university maker/hackerspaces, tool libraries, repair cafes/clinics, bicycle coops, and cooking Makerspaces.
