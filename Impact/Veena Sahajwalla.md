Continuing from where we left off, Veena Sahajwalla, the "Waste Queen," is known for her relentless passion for science, engineering, and technology. She is always on the lookout for materials that conventional recycling methods can't handle or that people haven't valued. She sees the potential in these materials and aims to unlock their value.

Veena's inspiration comes from her upbringing in Mumbai, India, where everything had value and potential. She was particularly influenced by her mother, a working pediatrician who managed both her professional and household duties. Veena's mother instilled in her the belief that anything is possible and encouraged her to do her best in everything.

Veena's journey took her from Mumbai to Vancouver, Canada, where she met her husband, Rama, while both were studying metallurgical engineering. Despite some initial resistance from their parents due to cultural expectations around arranged marriages, they eventually got married while still students.

Veena and Rama later moved to Australia, where Veena joined the University of New South Wales (UNSW) around 2000.

Here's a snippet from the video transcript: "The kind of materials that Veena is bringing in they’re either mixed in such a way that conventional recycling can’t currently recycle it, or it’s a material that people haven’t valued. Maybe HGPE and LGPE for the cover. I don’t know how often I have opened up a chip packet and gone this has great aluminium in it! Did you realise Keith it’s aluminium? Yeah exactly. The materials that we have collected here we can see and understand the value that is locked up in these materials."

Veena's research and innovations didn't stop at recycling tires into steel. She also started investigating the potential of other waste materials. One of her significant contributions is the concept of "green steel," where she proposed using waste plastics to replace coke, a fossil fuel, in the steel-making process. This idea was initially tested in a lab and later implemented in commercially operating furnaces.

In 2005, Veena's groundbreaking work earned her the Eureka Prize, considered the pinnacle of scientific achievement in Australia. Her invention was revolutionary as it went beyond traditional recycling and turned plastic into a resource. However, the challenge was to make her idea work in the real world and commercialize it.

Veena and her team then started looking at other waste materials, such as e-waste, which is one of the fastest-growing waste streams in the world. They found that these electronic devices contain good quality plastics that could potentially be recycled.

Here's a snippet from the video transcript: "People were too reliant on traditional coal and coke, no one was really looking at some of these other alternatives. Around about this time, there was a growing awareness of the problem of plastic pollution. We understood that plastics don't break down or they take thousands and thousands of years to break down. And Veena had this idea to take those plastic bottles that were starting to fill up the ground and the ocean using them to replace coke, a fossil fuel in the process of making steel. She called that idea green steel."

Veena's innovative work continued with the development of a process to recycle e-waste plastics into 3D printing filament. This process involves feeding the e-waste plastics into a machine that converts them into plastic filaments, which are then used as feedstock for 3D printing. One of the first products they created using this method was a pair of glasses modeled after Mahatma Gandhi's iconic pair.

Veena also experimented with combining problematic waste glass with waste textiles. After many trials and errors, they successfully produced beautiful green ceramics that have a designer-like look. This led to the development of a "micro factory," a series of modules that can transform various waste materials into new products.

The idea behind the micro factory is to enable local communities to take control of their waste and turn it into a resource. The ideal location for these micro factories is where the waste is being collected, such as local councils and regional centers, allowing communities to turn their waste into a small-scale industry.

In 2019, Veena received a call from someone at Mirvac, a company in the building sector. They collaborated on a project to create specific pieces, including a dining table made from waste glass and textile product, and side tables made from waste corflute banners collected on campus. This collaboration led to larger-scale projects, including flooring and walling applications made from recycled materials.

Here's a snippet from the video transcript: "A micro factory is a series of modules that can take a variety of different waste materials and transform it into a new product. This is the prototype micro factory for green ceramics. Textiles is one of the input materials that goes into making green ceramics. We combine our glass, textiles and in our micro factory this gets converted into a hard green ceramics."

The concept of the micro factory has been further developed and is now being implemented in real-world settings. Andrew, who runs a recycling business in Cootamundra, a small town about four and a half hours southwest of Sydney, is one of the first to set up a micro factory. His business mainly collects mattresses and tires, and with Veena's guidance, he has been able to unlock the value of these waste materials.

The first micro factory that will be commercially operational with green ceramics is now being set up at Andrew's site. The micro factory, costing between half a million to a million dollars, is being funded by a university grant. The goal is to have the micro factory running and producing commercial products by March.

In addition to this, Veena and her team have been working with Mirvac, a company in the building sector. They are redeveloping the old Channel Nine site in Sydney, and the waste from this site is going to Andrew's micro factory in Cootamundra. The aim is to create a circular economy where the waste is transformed into new products that can be used in their development.

Here's a snippet from the video transcript: "A micro factory like these costs between half a million, a million dollars, but this one's being funded by the university grant. As part of the grant we have to actually show that this micro factory is going to be running and ready, geared up, producing commercial products by about March. And that means we have to deliver."

The final part of the video talks about the future of Veena's work and the potential of her innovations. Veena is pushing the limits of her green steel technology by showing that more rubber can be used to substitute coal, with the ultimate goal of completely eliminating coal.

However, Veena acknowledges that solving the current challenges in waste management will require an army of people like her. In Australia, the skills and technology to achieve zero waste are already present. What's needed now is the will - from consumers, regulators, and legislators. By bringing all these together, there is potential to achieve a zero-waste economy, a circular economy.

Veena is confident that Australia can meet these challenges. She envisions a future where people actively seek resources and materials that come from waste streams. This would signify a significant change and a step towards a more sustainable future.

Here's a snippet from the video transcript: "In Australia, we have the skills and the technology to get to zero waste. What we need now is the will. We need the consumer will. We need the regulator and legislator will. And we bring all of those together. Then we actually have the potential, I believe, to get to a zero-waste economy, a circular economy."

```
Veena is known as the “Waste Queen”. She is transforming the way in which we manage waste, not just in Australia, but across the world. I see waste as an opportunity. To me waste is really one of those untapped resources, just waiting to be harnessed. Here in Australia, we are sitting at that tipping point. We have seen the export bans on waste come about and we can no longer send it somewhere overseas and it then becomes somebody else’s problem. We have to solve it, we have to do something about it.

The kind of materials that Veena is bringing in they’re either mixed in such a way that conventional recycling can’t currently recycle it, or it’s a material that people haven’t valued. Maybe HGPE and LGPE for the cover. I don’t know how often I have opened up a chip packet and gone this has great aluminium in it! Did you realise Keith it’s aluminium? Yeah exactly. The materials that we have collected here we can see and understand the value that is locked up in these materials.

People were too reliant on traditional coal and coke, no one was really looking at some of these other alternatives. Around about this time, there was a growing awareness of the problem of plastic pollution. We understood that plastics don't break down or they take thousands and thousands of years to break down. And Veena had this idea to take those plastic bottles that were starting to fill up the ground and the ocean using them to replace coke, a fossil fuel in the process of making steel. She called that idea green steel.

Typically a lot of this e-waste plastics will end up going to landfill. So Veena was able to develop a process that we could take those plastics reprocess them and produce 3D printing filament from them. The plastics from e-waste gets fed into this machine this then gets converted into plastic filaments which are basically like spaghetti and of course these types of plastic filaments get used as a feedstock for 3D printing. One of the first products that we did with 3d printing was a pair of Ghandi glasses and for Mahatma Ghandi’s glasses to be that iconic set of glasses that everyone can recognise was something that we wanted to showcase.

Veena was experimenting with a variety of waste materials, and one of the most promising out of it was the combination of problematic waste glass and combining that with waste textiles. So you know each year tonnes of clothes and curtains get thrown away there’s also a lot of glass that gets discarded ending up in landfill and I think for us it was really about looking at really being innovative doing a lot of experiments that allowed us to combine you know textiles and glass. But of course as you can imagine you know not every experiment works and not everything is successful at the start some of these things actually didn’t quite work but after a lot of experimentation of course we ended up producing these beautiful green ceramics and of course these have got this amazing designer-like look.

A micro factory is a series of modules that can take a variety of different waste materials and transform it into a new product. This is the prototype micro factory for green ceramics. Textiles is one of the input materials that goes into making green ceramics. We combine our glass, textiles and in our micro factory this gets converted into a hard green ceramics. We are actually with our micro factories re-imagining what manufacturing could look like in the future.

In Australia, we have the skills and the technology to get to zero waste. What we need now is the will. We need the consumer will. We need the regulator and legislator will. And we bring all of those together. Then we actually have the potential, I believe, to get to a zero-waste economy, a circular economy.
