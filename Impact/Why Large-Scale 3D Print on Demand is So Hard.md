Join us as we unpack the challenges and opportunities in large-scale, on-demand 3D printing. In this video, we go over our mission at Slant 3D, where we're aiming to transform the way manufacturing operates, evolving from a traditional mass production approach to a more customizable, large-scale one. Discover how we're striving to become a warehouse where the shelves make the product - a system where you can simply upload a file and receive a finished part in the mail a few days later. We'll discuss the hurdles we're facing, from manufacturing complexities to costs, the intricate design elements of 3D printing, and our pursuit of building a robust manufacturing process that matches human precision. Learn about the evolution of on-demand parts, the critical role of technology, and the future of manufacturing where products do not exist until someone orders them.

The video you've linked is titled "Why Large-Scale 3D Print on Demand is So Hard" and it's by the channel Slant 3D. The video was uploaded on July 4, 2023, and as of now, it has been viewed 6,662 times.

In this video, the team at Slant 3D discusses the challenges and opportunities in large-scale, on-demand 3D printing. They talk about their mission to transform the way manufacturing operates, moving from a traditional mass production approach to a more customizable, large-scale one. They aim to become a warehouse where the shelves make the product - a system where you can simply upload a file and receive a finished part in the mail a few days later.

They also discuss the hurdles they're facing, from manufacturing complexities to costs, the intricate design elements of 3D printing, and their pursuit of building a robust manufacturing process that matches human precision. The video covers the evolution of on-demand parts, the critical role of technology, and the future of manufacturing where products do not exist until someone orders them.

Here's a snippet from the video's transcript: "So at Slant 3D our operating goal is to become a warehouse where the shelves make the product a system where you can just upload a file out of the blue and get a final finished part in the mail a couple of days later...but the problem is and historically has always been that there's always been a component of time because if somebody's making a part for you they have to get feedback from you at the design from you verify that the final piece is what you want it to be and then send it along to you...this is not print on demand this is prototyping this is art and in order to take that art and scale it up is very very difficult..."

Here's the continuation of the transcript:

"...some process to be verified and inspected and make sure that it's up to certain tolerances and variation differences and controls all of that is a tough process to set up because that is a manufacturing process in order for it to be affordable we have to do it at very large scale and we have to do it very consistently but the problem is most manufacturing processes are set up to deal with one single part...but if you have many different parts or even worse have no idea at all what part will be coming down on any given day it has just become exponentially harder...

...now 3D printing has enabled this a bit it is a process that can reliably produce a part but the design of the part is so important for any manufacturing process that guaranteeing that a part is good quality when it comes off a machine and meets the expectations of the designer who may not have intimate knowledge of 3D printing is a very difficult thing to do...

...we are taking mass production and making it custom with so hard mass production is so easy to set up because you have Jigs and tools and dies and standard operating procedures for a few parts to where it's very easy to say ah we plugged in this it doesn't fit underneath this measurement that's what it is but it's one day somebody sends you a bracket and the next day somebody sends you a dragon figurine the rules are completely different between those two products of what the customer might want...

...right now we can produce hundreds of thousands or millions of the same part for a client and do it consistently and reliably but we cannot produce hundreds of thousands of individual parts and do them for the same cost and same speed as we would that individual mass-produced part but this is the Holy Grail of what we're going after because if we're able to crack it it positions us so well to create any product at any time and create a world where nothing ever exists until someone actually orders it..."

The video ends with the speaker wishing everyone a great day. It seems like a deep dive into the challenges and potential of large-scale, on-demand 3D printing. Is there anything else you'd like to know?
