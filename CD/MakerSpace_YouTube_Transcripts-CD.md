## Transcript (Reformatted)

Veena, also known as the “Waste Queen”, is revolutionizing waste management not just in Australia, but internationally. She sees waste as an untapped resource that is ripe for utilization. Currently, Australia is dealing with export bans on waste, which has forced the nation to rethink its management strategies and come up with innovative solutions.

Waste, especially polypropylene, fascinates Veena. She strongly believes that such materials could be efficiently repurposed within Australia instead of being disposed of as waste. Her innovative approach has led her to develop out-of-the-box solutions for waste management.

Two decades ago, she developed a novel method of integrating discarded tires into the steel-making process, effectively diverting millions of tires from landfill. Now, she has created a new product that merges textiles from worn-out clothes with glass, creating a new material for the construction industry.

Veena believes we are entering a new era of a materials revolution, similar to the Industrial Revolution and the technological revolution. She envisions a future where waste is perceived as a building block for new materials that can foster a circular economy. 

In her personal life, Veena's keen interest in waste management is also evident. Her husband and kids jokingly refer to her as a 'mega hoarder'. However, she describes herself as simply being curious. She is known for rigorously sorting through trash, ensuring that nothing which could potentially be repurposed is thrown away. Even simple household items, such as yogurt bottles, are subject to her repurposing scrutiny. 

Veena argues that Australia, and the world more generally, cannot maintain a 'business as usual' attitude towards waste management. She champions for a bold and innovative approach to utilizing what many consider being mere trash.I have a habit of randomly discarding trash, but there's always someone to gather it in our home. We have a designated area I have fondly named our "waste collection centre". I am particularly interested in rummaging through the trash for interesting discarded items. Certain ones contain potentially precious materials. For instance, there are some with shiny metallic layers, which I then add to my collection. This has been the starting point of my research journey into an array of fascinating materials. Every time I have gathered enough of them, I transport them to my office.

I have been part of Veena's team at the SMART Centre, a team of nearly 30 individuals passionate about waste recycling, for over five years now. Veena, our director, is an unstoppable force and it is indeed challenging to keep pace with her. She is immensely passionate about science, engineering, and technology. The materials Veena brings in are either so mixed that conventional recycling methods fail, or they are items not recognized for their value.

One such example is the use of HDPE and LDPE for coverings. It's not often that one opens a bag of chips and exclaims about the high-quality aluminum contained within. But once the materials are gathered we can decipher the hidden value. Therefore, it's incredibly important that these materials are examined further for potential use.

Many people take for granted the amount of trash that is casually discarded. However, growing up in the industrious city of Mumbai, India, there was no such thing as waste. Everything held value and potential. Mumbai, the industrial heartland of India is populated with more thanThe city has a population of 20 million and carries an amazing energetic buzz. I remember how I used to attend yoga sessions located on Marine Drive. I try to visit Mumbai once a year, ensuring to take my family along. As one of two children, I was especially close to my family throughout my adolescence, especially my mother. I recollect waking up at 5 o'clock in the morning to walk to the milk depot for the family's daily milk supply.

Veena's mom was a hardworking woman juggling her professional responsibilities as a pediatrician along with managing her home. This inspired Veena a lot. We have fond memories of her cooking large quantities of Sindhi curry, a dish that still remains special to us. 

My mom always believed in the power and potential of women. She often emphasized that women should rise to the top and never be subdued by men. She still strongly advocates for the empowerment of all women today. 

Growing up in Mumbai opened my eyes to the diversity of life and professions. From people repairing shoes to carrying heavy loads on their heads, everyone seemed to be engaged in productive work. I remember observing individuals who could repair and reuse an old discarded radio, which is an example of the city's immense focus on repair and reuse. It's remarkable to see a significant part of the economy still relying on the repair industry. 

These experiences played a crucial role in shaping my perspective and becoming a part of who I am today. Among my peers, I was quite unique to have pursued a career in science and engineering as a woman. It was a bit isolating being the only woman in the class but eventually, I graduated top of my class, which might not have been appreciated by all of my male colleagues. 

One of my notable patients was a man named Ganeesh who had fractured his foot. Being a doctor came in handy as I was able to treat him promptly.I met Veena in Vancouver, Canada, where we both studied metallurgical engineering. Veena joined as a graduate student and had just begun her Masters. There was a potential clash between us as I was excessively clean and she tended to be a bit messy due to her inclination of reusing things.

Our relationship became serious over time and when we informed our parents about our decision to marry, they weren't too pleased. Mostly because we were still students and also because traditionally in India, marriages are arranged by parents. However, after seeking their permission and letting them get to know more about each other, they eventually came around. We got married while we were still in school.

After obtaining my PhD in the States, I moved to Australia and eventually joined UNSW. Around 2000, I took a keen interest in researching the use of waste materials as resources for steelmaking. At that time, people relied heavily on traditional coal and coke and there was a lack of interest in exploring other alternatives.

Simultaneously, awareness of plastic pollution was growing as plastics don't degrade easily and take thousands of years to break down. Veena had the innovative idea of repurposing plastic bottles that were polluting the earth and seas by using them to replace coke, a fossil fuel, in the steelmaking process. She named this concept 'green steel'.

In the lab, I started working on the notion of using waste plastics for steel production. It was exhilarating when the initial experiments began to show positive results.Carrying out these incredible experiments is one thing, but the implementation in a practical, commercial environment, such as operating furnaces, is a different challenge altogether. This transition required quite a lot of work. Let me introduce myself, I'm James O'Loghlin and in 2005, I was hosting 'The New Inventors'. Professor Veena Sahajwalla was one of our panelists. 

The producers were on the lookout for more judges and they found Veena, an industrial innovator who was doing commendable work with steel, notably green steel. It was a surprise for Veena when a producer approached her, and she questioned her preparedness since this was very different from her day job. 

In the show, Veena showcased her creativity by utilizing operator's shoulder as a support for the cam boom. She always sought feedback for her performances, eager to improve each time. Despite her humility, it's noteworthy that Veena was accomplishing incredible and, in some ways, world-changing work. 

Soon after joining 'The New Inventors', she won the Eureka Prize, an award considered the pinnacle of scientific achievements in Australia. Her research has revolutionized the steel industry by demonstrating how waste plastic bottles can be used to make steel. This was a groundbreaking invention as she redefined the traditional concept of recycling, turning plastic into a useful resource. 

However, the real challenge for Veena was to prove that her innovative idea could be commercialised. Therefore, the time had finally come to put her work into action.The implementation of a new process at a steel plant became necessary, and required the identification of a cost-effective and easily accessible source of plastics. Millions of tyres, a potential source of carbon, are discarded to landfills in Australia, annually. This sparked the idea of using the waste rubber, especially seen in the tyres, as a possible alternative to coal in the production of green steel via electric arc furnace steelmaking.

In the early 2000s, while working at One Steel Sydney steel mill, I shared this innovative concept and it piqued the interest of the management. This resulted in plant trials which shows rubber granules could indeed be a substitute for coke. By 2011, the green steel technology was fully operational at the Sydney Steel Mill, before moving on to the electric arc furnace in Melbourne, and eventually internationally. Notably, we managed to replace more than a third of the coal-based carbon with waste tyres during the commercialization of the technology.

The commercialization of an idea is often challenging for many Australian researchers. Very few individuals can navigate this 'valley of death' successfully; Veena's achievement in this field is indeed remarkable. Her success helped secure the necessary funding and support to set up her smart centre. After developing the concept of green steel, Veena turned her attention to exploring potential uses of other waste materials for value-creation, including complex ones such as electronic waste (e-waste), which is quickly becoming one of the fastest growing waste streams globally.

Various electronics, including computers and phones, contain good quality plastics which often end up in landfills. Recognising this, Veena developed a process that repurposes these waste plastics into 3D printing filament.E-waste plastics are fed into a machine, which transforms them into plastic filaments. These filaments, resembling spaghetti, are primarily used to feed 3D printers. One of the first products we created using this method was a replica of Mahatma Gandhi's iconic glasses, aiming to display the machine's capabilities.

Veena also experimented with a variety of waste materials, like unwanted glass and textiles. Every year, tons of clothes, curtains, and glass are discarded, often ending up in landfills. Our focus was on innovative ways to reuse these materials. We experimented extensively with combining textiles and glass. Initially, not all experiments were successful; however, persistency led to the creation of unique green ceramics with a high-end, designer-like aesthetic.

Once the product was ready to market, we faced the challenge of mass-producing and distributing it. Veena wanted these products to have an impact on our communities and help address real waste challenges. We started by designing components and machinery that would enable us to produce these products on a larger scale, which we’ve dubbed a "micro factory." 

A micro factory consists of modules capable of transforming a variety of different waste materials into new products. For instance, our prototype micro factory for green ceramics uses discarded textiles as one of the primary input materials.We produce ceramics by combining our glass and textiles in a microfactory which converts these materials into a robust green ceramic product. We use our microfactories to reimagine what manufacturing could look like in the future. The idea behind these factories is to empower local communities to take control of their own resources. Ideal locations for these microfactories are places where waste is collected, such as local councils and regional centres, enabling communities to turn their waste into a resource and create a small-scale industry. 

We have received a commercialisation grant for our microfactory and as part of this grant agreement, we need to demonstrate that our factory can operate commercially, producing viable products. 

2019 was a pivotal year for us due to a call I received from someone at Mirvac, a company within the building and construction sector, which contributes to 60 percent of waste in Australia. This equates to around 41 million tonnes a year. 

They needed a sustainability initiative for a project and I was asked to pitch in using our product. I came up with a proposal and was quite impressed by the various avenues that we could explore. 

The first project we worked on with Mirvac involved creating a few specific items. There was a dining table made from our waste glass and textile product. Additionally, there were side tables manufactured from waste corflute and banners collected on campus. 

Seeing our prototypes used in such a practical manner was a remarkable moment. Following the success of our initial project, we were invited to work on a larger and more ambitious project by Mirvac.The range has expanded to include flooring and walling applications, as well as various creative uses. We worked with designers on the pieces for an apartment, where most items were crafted from glass and old clothes. For a specific designer wall, the desired look was softer, hence we incorporated jute bags in addition to glass. Jute, a type of plant, is used to make durable bags, often used for storing coffee beans. Upon entering the apartment, I was stunned by the variety of objects crafted from otherwise wasted materials, like school uniforms, coffee bags, and glass. We continually seek ways to broaden our applications and reach.

We have considered establishing an onsite micro-factory to manufacture green ceramics for our projects. Getting people to view themselves as manufacturers and embark on this journey with us is our ultimate goal.

I run a recycling business in Cootamundra, a small town around four and a half hours southwest of Sydney. We primarily collect mattresses and tires, initially thinking recycling mattresses would be simple. However, we were unprepared for the diverse materials present once the mattresses were disassembled. It has always been a passion of mine to deal with problem waste, so we aimed at finding the value in the deconstructed mattresses.

I met Andrew years ago, he was genuinely interested in recycling and our micro-factories. Our first micro-factory, which will focus on the commercial production of green ceramics, is now being set up at Andrew's site. This is happening in a small shed where we're assembling the micro-factory, which costs between half a million and a million dollars.The project is funded by a university grant with the requirement to demonstrate the operation of a functional micro-factory producing commercial products by March. Andrew, an acquaintance of ours for approximately seven years, heavily engaged in recycling initiatives in Cootamundra, is a key piece of this project. We've introduced Andrew and the property group Mirvac, with the hope of constructing beneficial partnerships. This has led to new opportunities, such as the redevelopment of Sydney's old Channel Nine site.

The site is rich with reusable materials such as electronics, plastic, computers, and even office furniture. The aim is to divert waste from the site to Andrew's micro-factory in Cootamundra. We strive for a circular economy approach where waste is repurposed and potentially brought back into our sustainable development projects. I have personally transported a large quantity of material from the Channel Nine site, which contained many useful items for our green ceramic tile project.

There is a lot of urgency due to the approaching deadline for the university grant. Our team, Anirban and Keith in particular, have made certain to keep the factory project on track despite the challenges. Our entire team visited the Cootamundra site recently for the inaugural operation of our micro-factory. The moment was filled with high emotion as the time had finally come to initiate the factory operations.When Andrew and I first began producing tiles in our micro-factory, there was a sense of both fear and anticipation. Yet, the excitement was palpable when the first tile was produced; it was a triumphant moment. Seeing the surprise on Andrew's face, who had never been a manufacturer before this point, was an added thrill. 

Our plan moving forward is to establish more of these micro-factories across Australia. The goal is to not only address our glass and textile waste but also transform problematic waste of different types. 

What makes 2021 exciting is the re-emergence of my first invention, green steel, which is still very much in use. Recently, Molycop started using green steel in their facility in Newcastle. Even though the technology has been around for over a decade, it's more relevant today than in the 2000s. This is because customers are increasingly demanding products made through sustainable methods. 

Currently, we're working on the next generation of green steel, focusing on how far we can push the limits of sustainable production. For instance, we're researching replacing coal with rubber tires. Ultimately, we want to eliminate the use of coal completely.

Veena plays an instrumental role, but solving the waste problems we have today will require an army of individuals like her. In Australia, we have the necessary skills and technology to achieve a zero-waste economy. Now, what's needed is collective will-power: consumers, regulators, and legislators all working towards the shared vision of a circular economy.I am extremely confident that Australia has the capability to tackle these challenges. A future where individuals actively seek out resources and materials originating from waste streams signifies the beginning of a monumental shift. The day when we all inspire each other to improve and excel is a day worth looking forward to. It would indeed be a remarkably beneficial development.

9.79: Veena is known as the “Waste Queen”. She
is transforming the way in which we manage
16.26: waste, not just in Australia, but across the
world.
20.14: I see waste as an opportunity. To me waste
is really one of those untapped resources,
28.34: just waiting to be harnessed. Here in Australia,
we are sitting at that tipping point. We have
37.99: seen the export bans on waste come about and
we can no longer send it somewhere overseas
43.11: and it then becomes somebody else’s problem.
We have to solve it, we have to do something
48.27: about it.
Veena is absolutely obsessed with waste.
53.2: All of this polypropylene easy to be remanufactured
right here in Australia, this should not be
61.66: wasted.
And you can see from some of the work she’s
64.739: done, she completely steps out of the box
to solve the problem.
70.439: Twenty years ago, she invented a way to recycle
tyres into the steel making process and saved
76.19: millions of tyres from going into landfill.
Now she's invented a new product that combines
82.97: the textiles from old clothes with glass and
turns them into a product for the building
88.4: industry.
It’s a paradigm shift. We have had the Industrial
94.159: Revolution, we’ve now got this technical
revolution. I think she’s talking about
98.36: a materials revolution.
So what you can see behind me here is plastics
103.35: and other waste materials some of this is
destined for landfill but we can use these
109.1: materials as building blocks for making new
materials for new manufacturing and new circular
115.659: economies.
Australia really cannot continue to assume
121.88: that it's business as usual. And I think we
need to be bold and brave and think big.
146.319: My husband and my kids, they would absolutely
define me as the mega hoarder.
153.65: I don't see myself as a hoarder. I just see
myself as somebody who is curious.
158.86: I think Mum had a few funny quirks that made
her a little bit different to other Mums.
166.639: She was definitely the rubbish cop, really
making sure if we were going to throw something
172.969: did it need to be thrown? Could we use it?
Before I take the garbage outside she’ll
180.45: make sure she goes through the entire garbage.
Things like yoghurt boxes. I just throw it
185.579: but she’ll just go and pick it up. We have
a place in the house. I call it waste collection
191.34: centre. And, you know, we’ve got all kinds
of stuff there.
195.28: You know what I really like to pick out of
garbage is all these exciting products that
198.87: have potentially valuable materials in it.
Like in this case you can see this shiny metallic
204.39: layer and that’s what I like to harness
and that becomes part of my collection.
210.029: And this is really how a lot of my research
journey starts in all kinds of incredibly
214.659: wonderful materials. So every time I collect
enough of these materials, it comes with me
222.159: to the office.
I've been working with Veena for over five
232.139: years now at the SMART Centre, and it's always
had a team of about 30 people, of passionate
238.639: young engineers and scientists working in
the space of waste recycling. Veena is the
245.069: director. Keeping up with Veena is the challenge.
247.959: Well hello hello.
Hello. What do you have what have you brought
252.279: for us.
Lots of goodies, right.
254.609: She will not stop talking about science and
engineering and technology, it's, uh, from
259.76: one idea to the next. it’s part of everything
that she does. The kind of materials that
267.26: Veena is bringing in they’re either mixed
in such in such a way that conventional recycling
271.78: can’t currently recycle it, or it’s a
material that people haven’t valued.
276.72: Maybe HGPE and LGPE for the cover.
I don’t know how often I have opened up
281.45: a chip packet and gone this has great aluminium
in it!
284.16: Did you realise Keith it’s aluminium?
Yeah exactly.
287.25: The materials that we have collected here
we can see and understand the value that is
292.1: locked up in these materials.
So I think someone needs to look at that.
295.09: Absolutely.
I think that’s potentially a good project.
296.6: Well you know there’s so much stuff that
we just throw away and we just take it for
302.4: granted, but you know growing up in Mumbai,
in India, where I was born there was no such
310.01: thing as a waste. Everything had value and
everything had potential.
320.23: Mumbai is a city that is the industrial heartland
of India. Population of more than 20 million.
330.63: And it’s got an amazing buzz to it.
You remember I used to go for the yoga where
339.52: was it, the one on Marine Drive.
Try and go back to Mumbai about once a year
346.98: and take my family with me. I’m one of two
kids. Growing up I was very close to my family,
356.7: but particularly really, really very close
to my mother.
358.91: 5 ‘clock in the morning I remember you used
to get up and you used to walk to the milk
363.99: depot to go and get milk for the family.
Veena’s mum was a doctor. She was actually
370.8: a paediatrician. You know, her mum was working
and looking after the house and doing everything.
376.99: So that really inspired Veena a lot.
I remember also when you used to make a big
381.87: Sindhi curry. Sindhi curry I remember cause
you used to make it big, Sini curry is like
384.55: well you explain.
For my mother it was absolutely. anything
387.25: is possible. Do what you love, but do it at
your very best and be your best.
393.65: Ganeesh Ganeesh his name was Ganeesh. He fractured
his foot.
397.39: Lucky you‘re a doctor.
I gave him straight away plaster,
405.45: My expectation was is that all women should
be on the top, they should never be under
417.82: any man, that’s even today. I’m talking
for all women.
422.33: My parents were absolutely the ones who inspired
us to be curious about things. You know, as
434.721: a kid in Mumbai there is so much to see and
I’d see people working, repairing shoes.
442.96: People carting all kinds of heavy things on
their heads, for example. An old discarded
449.49: radio for instance, that they would feel that
they could they could fix it and use it .
456.18: Even today there is a big part of the economy
that operates off the back of repairing things.
463.14: And how amazing is that?
All these experiences that I had as a child
469.68: growing up it, I think, had a role to play
in what got into my system, into my DNA. Amongst
479.37: my female friends, I was probably quite unusual
in pursuing my love for science and engineering.
487.389: As the only woman in the class that was a
bit isolating. By the time I graduated, I
495.02: finished up at the top of the class. Some
of the male colleagues I’m sure were not
500.74: entirely delighted.
I met Veena in Vancouver, Canada. We both
508.139: studied metallurgical engineering. And Veena,
joined as a graduate student, just started
512.95: her Masters.
There was a potential clash because I was
516.01: absolutely a clean freak. But she was kind
of a little bit messy because she just wanted
519.87: to keep reusing things and I wanted to throw
things.
522.899: Rama and I started to go out and when it all
became very serious our parents were informed
529.7: and weren’t too happy that Rama and I as
students had really decided that we were going
533.93: to get married. But the other important thing
that bothered them was the fact that this
538.22: was their role.
A lot of the marriages in India are, you know,
541.879: arranged marriages. I had to ask my parents
for their permission. So I had to send them
547.319: a photo, Veena had to do the same thing. Her
parents were actually trying to do, some investigation
554.07: to find a little bit more about me. I guess
they must have found something good. In the
560.319: end we got married whilst we were doing our
studies.
567.449: So I came to Australia after finishing up
my PhD in the States and eventually came to
572.939: UNSW. Around about in 2000 and thereabouts,
I really got excited about you know researching
580.36: more of waste materials as resources for steelmaking.
People were too reliant on traditional coal
589.66: and coke, no one was really looking at some
of these other alternatives.
595.339: Around about this time, there was a growing
awareness of the problem of plastic pollution.
601.42: We understood that plastics don't break down
or they take thousands and thousands of years
605.48: to break down. And Veena had this idea to
take those plastic bottles that were starting
611.52: to fill up the ground and the ocean using
them to replace coke, a fossil fuel in the
616.959: process of making steel. She called that idea
green steel.
622.139: What we’re going to do is we’re actually
going to be feeding in our plastics sample
626.74: in there and the idea is we want to be able
to inject it into this furnace here.
631.559: I started working on the idea of using waste
plastics in the lab when the experiments started
637.149: to work, it was exciting. You know it’s
one thing to do these incredibly amazing experiments
642.93: in the lab, but a whole another ball game
when you have to actually take it out into
647.47: practise, into actual commercially operating
furnaces. So there was quite a lot of work
655.769: to be done
656.769: Hello I’m James O’Loghlin welcome.
2005 I was hosting The New Inventors.
665.97: On our panel is Professor Veena Sahajwalla.
Producers were looking for some more judges
673.3: and they discovered this woman who was an
industrial innovator and doing some amazing
679.29: work with steel and in particular green steel.
I was you know approached by a producer, it
686.069: was a bit of a surprise, and you know I was
like, ‘Gosh, am I prepared for this?’
693.749: I mean like this is not my day job.
Veena what do you think Veena: You’ve been
697.829: very creative in using the operator’s shoulder
as a means to support the cam boom.
702.98: She always used to ask me after we’d done
a show or even in rehearsal actually. How
708.279: did that sound? What could I do better?
What are the advantages of your system compared
712.55: to the others.
She was very humble but Veena had a lot not
717.829: to be humble about. She was doing amazing
work and in some ways world changing work
723.41: And then shortly after she joined The New
Inventors, she won the Eureka Prize.
729.649: The UNSW 2005 Eureka prize for scientific
research, Professor Veena Sahajwalla.
737.439: A colleague of mine had to literally nudge
me off the chair, going, “They’ve called
743.29: your name”.
Professor Veena Sahajwalla’s research has
746.399: shown the steel industry how to use waste
plastic bottles to make steel. It’s been
751.49: a hard sell in a conservative industry.
The Eureka Prizes, they're really considered
757.05: to be the Oscars of Australian science and
the one that Veena won is really the pinnacle
763.29: of scientific achievement in Australia
Her invention was groundbreaking because she
768.83: went beyond the traditional notions of recycling
and reusing and turned the plastic into a
774.459: resource, but the pressure was on now for
Veena to demonstrate that she could make her
779.199: idea work in the real world and commercialise
it.
782.379: Now the time had come when actually the work
of implementation at a steel plant had to
787.05: happen.
We had to work out where plastics would come
789.579: from. We really needed an affordable cost-effective
source.
795.209: Well in Australia each year millions of these
kinds of tyres end up in landfill, the rubber
803.879: in tyres like many waste plastics is actually
a really good source of carbon. So I remember
810.17: thinking back then that this could be a fantastic
substitute for some of the coal that could
816.439: be used in electric arc furnace steelmaking
to make green steel.
822.399: I was working at One Steel Sydney steel mill
in the early 2000s.
827.73: The management were very interested in Veena’s
idea.
831.059: This is some of the material?
Yeah this is what we call our nut coke pile.
835.8: Plant trials demonstrated that rubber granules
could be used as a replacement for coke. In
841.68: 2011, the green steel technology was introduced
to Sydney Steel Mill, followed by the electric
848.49: arc furnace in Melbourne and then taken overseas.
When the technology was actually getting commercialised,
856.05: we were actually replacing more than a third
of the coal-based carbon through waste tyres.
865.85: For a lot of Australian researchers, the bringing
their idea to market the commercialisation
870.329: of their work can be the valley of death.
There aren’t many who make it through that
874.679: and succeed. So what Veena had done was really
special. And this enabled her to attract the
881.949: kind of funding and support that she needed
to get started with her smart centre.
888.07: After green steel Veena started investigating
and thinking about what other materials are
892.55: out there that are waste materials but have
value, other complex waste materials, such
897.589: as e-waste.
Well e-waste is actually one of the fastest
900.939: growing waste streams in the world you know
we’ve got so many different types of electronics
905.68: you know our computers our phones and of course
there’s a lot of good quality plastics in
911.81: there and you know typically a lot of this
e-waste plastics will end up going to landfill.
917.269: So Veena was able to develop a process that
we could take those plastics reprocess them
924.879: and produce 3D printing filament from them.
The plastics from e-waste gets fed into this
930.91: machine this then gets converted into plastic
filaments which are basically like spaghetti
937.249: and of course these types of plastic filaments
get used as a feedstock for 3D printing.
944.759: One of the first products that we did with
3d printing was a pair of Ghandi glasses and
949.5: for Mahatma Ghandi’s glasses to be that
iconic set of glasses that everyone can recognise
955.35: was something that we wanted to showcase.
Veena was experimenting with a variety of
962.179: waste materials, and one of the most promising
out of it was the combination of problematic
966.959: waste glass and combining that with waste
textiles.
970.68: So you know each year tonnes of clothes and
curtains get thrown away there’s also a
976.76: lot of glass that gets discarded ending up
in landfill and I think for us it was really
983.519: about looking at really being innovative doing
a lot of experiments that allowed us to combine
988.839: you know textiles and glass .But of course
as you can imagine you know not every experiment
994.619: works and not everything is successful at
the start some of these things actually didn’t
998.699: quite work but after a lot of experimentation
of course we ended up producing these beautiful
1004.389: green ceramics and of course these have got
this amazing designer-like look.
1009.82: She got to the point that she had a product
that could be marketed the next step was how
1015.769: do we produce it and how do we take it out
into the marketplace.
1020.49: Veena really wanted to take an entrepreneurial
route to actually get this product out into
1025.85: our communities and our homes, to be able
to show that the science that’s developed
1030.77: in these labs over many years can have real
impact in our communities and solve real waste
1037.81: challenges. We started designing components
and machinery.
1044.75: And that package we’ve ended up calling
a micro factory. A micro factory is a series
1051.44: of modules that can take a variety of different
waste materials and transform it into a new
1058.02: product.
1059.58: This is the prototype micro factory for green
ceramics. Textiles is one of the input materials
1065.73: that goes into making green ceramics. We combine
our glass, textiles and in our micro factory
1073.3: this gets converted into a hard green ceramics.
We are actually with our micro factories re-imagining
1081.81: what manufacturing could look like in the
future.
1085.98: One of the ideas behind the micro factory
is to really enable people and local communities
1091.14: to take control of their own. The ideal location
for these kinds of micro factories is where
1098.73: the waste is being collected, local councils,
regional centres so that you can really have
1104.82: communities able to access them and turn their
own waste into a resource, into a small-scale
1111.32: industry.
We currently have a grant for commercialization
1116.74: of our micro factory, We have to deliver.
As part of the grant, we have to show that
1121.96: we’re going to have a commercially operating
micro factory that makes viable products.
1130.67: 2019 was really a big year for us because
I got a phone call from someone at Mirvac.
1138.02: It was just amazing because here I was, I’d
been reaching out to the building sector for
1143.24: a long time.
The building and construction industry contribute
1148.38: to 60 percent of waste in Australia, which
equates to around 41 million tonnes a year.
1156.26: We needed to come up with a sustainability
initiative for a particular project. So I
1161.07: went away and did a little bit of research.
I was extremely impressed by the work that
1166.07: Veena was doing And I just saw so many avenues
that we could pursue.
1175.16: The first project that Mirvac, uh, tested
us out on was creating a few specific pieces.
1181.95: One of those was a dining table, made from
our waste glass and textile product. There
1186.52: were some side tables that were made from
waste corflute, banners that were collected
1191.03: here on campus.
When you’ve got orientation week and all
1194.85: that and the banners come down.
To actually see that in a real world setting
1199.04: was really almost that sort of goosebumps
moment when you walk in then you go, ‘Oh
1204.94: my gosh, these are our prototypes’.
After our first project, we asked Veena if
1211.82: she’d come on board with something a lot
larger in scale and much more ambitious.
1217.36: We’ve now actually put in another range.
It’s gone into flooring applications, walling
1224.53: applications, and really all kinds of very
creative applications.
1229.35: We consulted with designers for the pieces
in this apartment and most of the pieces are
1235.92: made out of glass and old clothes except for
this particular designer wall they actually
1242.01: wanted a softer look so in addition to glass
we’ve incorporated jute bags. Jute is basically
1248.21: a plant and jute bags are strong and sturdy
and they are used to store coffee beans.
1254.55: I remember walking into the apartment and
just being blown away by the variety of things
1262.13: that she’d been able to create out of what
would have been considered waste materials,
1267.93: school uniforms and coffee bags and glass.
We've just been looking for ways to expand
1273.39: and take it further and further.
We talked about actually creating our own
1277.3: micro factory on site so that we could create
and produce green ceramics for our projects.
1283.41: That’s exactly what we’ve been looking
at doing, is really taking people with us
1287.95: on that journey where they can reimagine themselves
as manufacturers.
1294.45: I've been running a recycling business in
Cootamundra. It's a small town. It's about
1300.89: four and a half hours south west of Sydney.
We mainly collect mattresses and tyres. We
1306.76: thought it'd be an easy process to recycle
mattresses. We were a bit unprepared for what
1312.3: happens when you pull a mattress apart. You're
left with lots of different materials. It's
1315.552: been a passion of mine to look at problem
waste. So it was trying to unlock the value
1322.98: of that mattress once you’ve deconstructed
it and Veena was there to offer a guiding
1329.89: hand.
I met Andrew several years ago and he was
1335.0: really interested in the work that we were
doing in recycling and started to show interest
1340.94: in our micro factories. Our first micro factory
that’s going to be up and running commercially
1346.51: with green ceramics is, indeed, now going
to be at Andrew’s site.
1351.88: This is where we're assembling the micro factory
inside the small shed. A micro factory like
1356.46: these costs between half a million, a million
dollars, but this one's being funded by the
1359.99: university grant.
As part of the grant we have to actually show
1364.91: that this micro factory is going to be running
and ready, geared up, producing commercial
1371.62: products by about March. And that means we
have to deliver.
1376.53: Well we’ve actually known Andrew for a while
now.
1378.05: How long is that?
A few years now.
1379.05: Andrew: Seven years I think.
Veena: Seven years my goodness.
1382.34: Andrew does a lot of work on recycling he’s
out at Cootamundra.
1386.01: We have been telling Mirvac about Andrew,
and you know in Andrew’s case, we’ve been
1388.83: telling him about Mirvac. So out of this,
of course, conversation, new opportunities
1395.38: are emerging.
So we’re redeveloping the old Channel Nine
1401.06: site in Sydney.
There that is so nice.
1405.25: There are electronics, there’s plastic,
there’s computers, there’s desks.
1407.53: That is polycarbonate right?
It should be.
1410.73: There’s a whole building full of materials.
Waste from this site it is going to Andrew
1417.49: in Cootamundra to a micro factory there.
This is really, really heavy.
1423.74: The idea is always, of course, to be circular
in the economy and to to get the waste to
1427.78: Andrew and then hopefully buy the things back
then we can use them in our development
1431.57: I brought back a ute load of material from
the Channel Nine site so it was a bit of an
1438.29: Aladdin's Cave in there. There's some really
useful stuff there for the green ceramic tile,
1444.85: particularly this big black curtain that they
use behind the stage. It was perfect for what
1450.871: we want to do. I'm conscious we're coming
up against a hard deadline for a grant that
1455.39: the University received. Anirban and Keith
have been tireless in coming down here and
1460.121: making sure we get the factory up and running.
So the last couple of weeks have been very
1466.13: difficult, but the guys have put a lot of
effort in. Our whole team came down to Cootamundra
1473.1: today for a first major run of our micro factory.
All set now, ok.
1480.76: It's been a long journey. And I think there
were lots of us in there today feeling really
1484.82: emotional. The time had really arrived for
us to literally flick the switch.
1490.99: You’re going to have to.
No.
1493.09: Oh no I don’t know I mean come on Andrew.
Oh this is exciting ok here we go.
1507.33: When we actually started producing the tiles,
there was that sense of fear and also wonder
1513.69: as to what it might look like in this micro
factory for the very first time. But what
1518.56: was absolutely awesome to see that very first
tile that that came out of out of the micro
1522.78: factory was simply brilliant.
Oh success
1530.94: And it was actually fantastic to see almost
that look on Andrew's face.
1536.93: Wow that is amazing.
Well done team.
1541.68: Brilliant.
Andrew who had really never been a manufacturer
1544.49: he now was now becoming a manufacturer, that's
a big moment.
1549.51: It is fantastic.
The plan is from here on to roll out this
1554.41: and other kinds of micro factories across
Australia so we can deal with not only our
1560.3: glass and textile waste, but also transform
all kinds of problematic waste. Well 2021
1573.68: is really looking very exciting. the first
ever invention of mine, green steel, which
1581.48: is still going strong. And this year Molycop
has started using green steel in their facility
1587.75: in Newcastle.
Even though green steel technology’s been
1592.86: around for over a decade, it’s even more
relevant today than what it was back in the
1596.93: 2000s because our customers are demanding
that the products that they purchase have
1601.44: been made from sustainable methods.
The next generation of green steel that we’re
1610.3: working on is really about showing that we
can push those limits.
1615.17: It’s a great sign it’s a great sign that
you can actually show you bring in more rubber.
1621.25: We’re going to have more and more substitution
of that coal with rubber tyres to get to that
1626.85: ultimate complete elimination of coal.
1632.37: Veena's playing a critical role but it’s
going to take an army of people like Veena
1637.51: to solve our current challenges in waste.
In Australia, we have the skills and the technology
1644.46: to get to zero waste. What we need now is
the will. We need the consumer will. We need
1650.68: the regulator and legislator will. And we
bring all of those together. Then we actually
1655.53: have the potential, I believe, to get to a
zero -waste economy, a circular economy.
1660.66: You know I am really confident that Australia
can meet these challenges.
1664.63: When we start to see a future where people
are going out and asking for resources and
1670.9: materials that come from waste streams then
I think we would see that we are at the cusp
1676.89: of that change. And that would be a really,
really good thing when we’re all inspiring
1682.62: each other to do things better.
