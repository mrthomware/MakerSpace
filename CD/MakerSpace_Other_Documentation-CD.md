Yes, managing tasks and associated files in a database like SQLite3 is a great way to make the application more robust and scalable. By storing tasks and file information in a database, you can persist the data, query it efficiently, and make the application more maintainable.

Here's how you can implement SQLite3 for managing tasks and files in your Kanban app:

---

### **Steps to Integrate SQLite3**

#### 1. **Set Up SQLite3 Database**
- Add a database file, e.g., `kanban.db`, to your project.
- Define tables to store Kanban boards, tasks, and file information.

**Schema Design:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE boards (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    name TEXT NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE tasks (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    title TEXT NOT NULL,
    status TEXT CHECK (status IN ('To Do', 'In Progress', 'Done')) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'To Do',
    include_checkbox BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    file_name TEXT,
    board_id INTEGER,
    FOREIGN KEY (board_id) REFERENCES boards (id)
);
```

#### 2. **Flask Integration**
Modify the Flask app to use SQLite3 for managing tasks and files.

**Code Example:**
Add a helper function to connect to the database:
```python
import sqlite3

DATABASE = "kanban.db"

def get_db_connection():
    conn = sqlite3.connect(DATABASE)
    conn.row_factory = sqlite3.Row
    return conn
```

---

#### 3. **CRUD Operations**
Implement CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for boards and tasks.

**Create a New Board:**
```python
@app.route('/api/boards', methods=['POST'])
def create_board():
    data = request.json
    board_name = data.get('name')
    if not board_name:
        return jsonify({"error": "Board name is required"}), 400

    conn = get_db_connection()
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    cursor.execute("INSERT INTO boards (name) VALUES (?)", (board_name,))
    conn.commit()
    board_id = cursor.lastrowid
    conn.close()

    return jsonify({"id": board_id, "name": board_name}), 201
```

**Add a Task:**
```python
@app.route('/api/tasks', methods=['POST'])
def add_task():
    task_title = request.form.get('taskTitle')
    status = 'To Do'
    include_checkbox = request.form.get('includeCheckbox') == 'on'
    file = request.files.get('taskFile')
    board_id = 1  # Default to the first board

    if not task_title:
        return jsonify({"error": "Task title is required"}), 400

    # Save the file if uploaded
    file_name = None
    if file:
        file_name = file.filename
        file.save(os.path.join(file_storage_path, file_name))

    conn = get_db_connection()
    conn.execute(
        "INSERT INTO tasks (title, status, include_checkbox, file_name, board_id) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?)",
        (task_title, status, include_checkbox, file_name, board_id),
    )
    conn.commit()
    conn.close()

    return jsonify({"message": "Task added successfully"}), 201
```

**Retrieve Tasks for a Board:**
```python
@app.route('/api/boards/<int:board_id>/tasks', methods=['GET'])
def get_tasks(board_id):
    conn = get_db_connection()
    tasks = conn.execute("SELECT * FROM tasks WHERE board_id = ?", (board_id,)).fetchall()
    conn.close()

    task_list = [dict(task) for task in tasks]
    return jsonify(task_list), 200
```

---

#### 4. **Display Tasks in HTML**
Update the `index.html` template to fetch tasks dynamically using the Flask API.

**Example Fetch Tasks with JavaScript:**
```javascript
function loadTasks(boardId) {
    fetch(`/api/boards/${boardId}/tasks`)
        .then(response => response.json())
        .then(tasks => {
            const taskContainer = document.getElementById('task-container');
            taskContainer.innerHTML = ''; // Clear existing tasks

            tasks.forEach(task => {
                const taskElement = document.createElement('div');
                taskElement.innerHTML = `
                    <p>${task.title}</p>
                    ${task.file_name ? `<a href="/api/files/${task.file_name}" target="_blank">View File</a>` : ''}
                `;
                taskContainer.appendChild(taskElement);
            });
        });
}
```

---

### **Advantages of Using SQLite3**
1. **Persistence:** Tasks and files are stored permanently.
2. **Flexibility:** Query data efficiently, e.g., filter tasks by status.
3. **Scalability:** Easily adapt to larger datasets by switching to another database like PostgreSQL or MySQL if needed.
4. **Backup and Migration:** The database can be easily backed up or migrated.

Let me know if you'd like me to integrate SQLite3 into the project and update the files for you!
