Consider starting with basic tools and expanding as demand grows.\n   - **Stock Materials:** Keep a basic inventory of commonly used materials and establish a system for members to contribute or purchase additional supplies.\n   - **Build a Community:** Foster a community through events, collaborative projects, and social media. Encourage members to share skills and knowledge.\n   - **Educational Programs:** Develop a range of educational offerings, from beginner workshops to advanced project-based classes.\n   - **Sustainable Management:** Implement a membership system, establish rules and guidelines, and possibly hire staff or rely on volunteers for maintenance and administration.\n\n4. **Test and Iterate:**\n   - **Feedback Loop:** Regularly gather feedback from users to understand their needs and challenges.\n   - **Adapt and Evolve:** Continuously adapt the space, tools, materials, and programs based on user feedback and changing needs.\n\nBy using first-principles thinking, we've deconstructed the concept of a Maker Space and then reconstructed it in a way that is focused on its core purposes: fostering creativity, learning, and community collaboration. This approach ensures the space is designed and operated in a way that meets the fundamental needs of its users.","x":-340,"y":-490,"width":794,"height":1240},

Keep in mind that Mermaid syntax is designed for simplicity, so this representation will be somewhat abstracted.\n\nHere's a basic Mermaid diagram to model the current education system:\n\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n    A[Primary Education] -->|Advancement| B[Secondary Education]\n    B -->|University Entrance Exams| C[Tertiary Education]\n    B -->|Vocational Training| D[Vocational Education]\n    C -->|Graduation| E[Workforce/Professional World]\n    C -->|Further Studies| F[Postgraduate Education]\n    F --> E\n    D --> E\n\n    subgraph Curriculum and Pedagogy\n    G[Standardized Curriculum]\n    H[Pedagogical Approaches]\n    end\n\n    subgraph Assessment and Evaluation\n    I[Standardized Testing]\n    J[Continuous Assessment]\n    end\n\n    subgraph Governance and Administration\n    K[Government Role]\n    L[School Administration]\n    end\n\n    subgraph Technology Integration\n    M[E-Learning Platforms]\n    N[Educational Resources]\n    end\n\n    A --> G\n    B --> G\n    C --> G\n    D --> G\n    A --> H\n    B --> H\n    C --> H\n    D --> H\n\n    A --> I\n    B --> I\n    C --> I\n    D --> I\n    A --> J\n    B --> J\n    C --> J\n    D --> J\n\n    A --> K\n    B --> K\n    C --> K\n    D --> K\n    A --> L\n    B --> L\n    C --> L\n    D --> L\n\n    A --> M\n    B --> M\n    C --> M\n    D --> M\n    A --> N\n    B --> N\n    C --> N\n    D --> N\n```\n\nThis diagram illustrates the progression of students through the educational system, starting from primary education and potentially moving through to the workforce or further studies. It also highlights the interconnected roles of curriculum, pedagogy, assessment, governance, and technology integration in each stage of education.","x":320,"y":4700,"width":1710,"height":1603},
