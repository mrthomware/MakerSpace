# Applications of Makerspaces  

Makerspaces are collaborative workspaces inside a school, library, or separate public/private facility for making, learning, exploring, and sharing that uses high tech to no tech tools. They are open to kids, adults, and entrepreneurs and have a variety of maker equipment including 3D printers, laser cutters, CNC machines, soldering irons, and even sewing machines. However, a makerspace doesn’t need to include all of these machines or even any of them to be considered a makerspace. If you have cardboard, Legos, and art supplies, you're in business.  

The core of a makerspace is the maker mindset of creating something out of nothing and exploring your own interests. These spaces are also helping to prepare those who need the critical 21st-century skills in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM). They provide hands-on learning, help with critical thinking skills, and even boost self-confidence. Some of the skills that are learned in a makerspace pertain to electronics, 3D printing, 3D modeling, coding, robotics, and even woodworking.  

Makerspaces are also fostering entrepreneurship and are being utilized as incubators and accelerators for business startups. There have already been some amazing success stories that have come out of makerspaces to date. 

Here are just some of the things you can do in a makerspace:   

Coding  
3D printing  
Laser cutting  
Soldering  
Electronics / Arduino  
Robot building / Robotics  
Learn Circuits and Electricity with paper circuits  
Sewing  
Woodworking  
Take-a-part sessions  
Inventing  
Makerspaces are not only a place where you can make stuff but many times it's a place where you make "meaning" which many times is more important than the stuff you make.  

In conclusion, Makerspaces are zones of self-directed learning. Their hands-on character, coupled with the tools and raw materials that support invention, provide the ultimate workshop for the tinkerer and the perfect  
educational space for individuals who learn best by doing. They promote multidisciplinary thinking and learning, enriching the projects that are built there and the value of the makerspace as an educational venue.

#Concept Explanation

A Makerspace, also known as a hackerspace, hacklab, or hackspace, is a community-operated workspace where individuals with common interests, such as computers, machining, technology, science, digital art, or electronic art, can meet, socialize, and collaborate. These spaces are often not-for-profit and are comparable to other community-operated spaces with similar aims and mechanisms such as Fab Lab, men's sheds, and commercial "for-profit" companies.

## History

The concept of Makerspaces has been around since 2006, with the establishment of Metalab in Vienna, Austria. The advent of crowdfunding and platforms like Kickstarter has made it easier to establish these spaces. The number of Makerspaces has grown significantly over the years, with a significant increase from 2006 to 2016. The US federal government has also adopted the concept of Makerspaces within its agencies.

## Activities

Makerspaces function as centers for peer learning and knowledge sharing, in the form of workshops, presentations, and lectures. They also offer social activities for their members, such as game nights and parties. Many Makerspaces participate in the use and development of free software, open hardware, and alternative media.

## Facilities

The specific tools and resources available at Makerspaces vary from place to place. They typically provide space for members to work on their individual projects, or to collaborate on group projects with other members. The building or facility the Makerspace occupies provides physical infrastructure that members need to complete their projects. In addition to space, most Makerspaces provide electrical power, computer servers, and networking with Internet connectivity.

## Organization

The individual character of a Makerspace is determined by its members. Some Makerspaces are governed by elected boards selected by active members in good standing. Others are led by a single Benevolent Dictator For Life (BDFL). Membership fees are usually the main income of a Makerspace, but some also accept external sponsors.

## Ethic

Makerspaces generally follow a “hacker ethic”, which includes freedom, in the sense of autonomy as well as of free access and circulation of information; distrust of authority, opposing the traditional, industrial top-down style of organization; embracing the concept of learning by doing and peer-to-peer learning processes as opposed to formal modes of learning; sharing, solidarity, and cooperation.

Equity and justice-centered making

Makerspaces potentially offer opportunities for young people to engage in STEM knowledge and practices in creative and playful ways. However, an explicit equity-agenda has been fairly absent in the maker movement, especially as it relates to sustained engagement in making. The movement remains an adult, white, middle-class pursuit, led by those with the leisure time, technical knowledge, experience, and resources to make.

## Difficulties and critique

Makerspaces can run into difficulties with building codes or other planning regulations, which may not be designed to handle their scope of activities. The difficulties with opening Makerspaces and Makerspaces within non-profit organizations, such as schools and public libraries include cost, space, liability, and availability of personnel. Many Makerspaces struggle to sustain viable business models in support of their missions.

#Variations

There are many variations of Makerspaces, including public library Makerspaces, feminist Makerspaces, public school maker/hackerspaces, Fab labs, community spaces, university maker/hackerspaces, tool libraries, repair cafes/clinics, bicycle coops, and cooking Makerspaces.

# Demographics of Maker Spaces

Here is a summary of the demographics of Maker Spaces based on the information from the Lakehead University Library:

Maker Spaces are collaborative workspaces inside schools, libraries, or separate public/private facilities for making, learning, exploring, and sharing. They use a range of tools from high tech to no tech. These spaces are open to kids, adults, and entrepreneurs and have a variety of maker equipment including 3D printers, laser cutters, CNC machines, soldering irons, and even sewing machines. However, a makerspace doesn’t need to include all of these machines or even any of them to be considered a makerspace. If you have cardboard, legos, and art supplies, you're in business. It's more about the maker mindset of creating something out of nothing and exploring your own interests that's at the core of a makerspace.

These spaces are also helping to prepare those who need the critical 21st-century skills in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM). They provide hands-on learning, help with critical thinking skills, and even boost self-confidence. Some of the skills that are learned in a makerspace pertain to electronics, 3D printing, 3D modeling, coding, robotics, and even woodworking. Makerspaces are also fostering entrepreneurship and are being utilized as incubators and accelerators for business startups.

- **Age Range**: Maker Spaces are open to all age groups, from kids to adults.
- **Occupation**: Maker Spaces cater to students, professionals, entrepreneurs, hobbyists, and anyone interested in making.
- **Interests**: Users of Maker Spaces are typically interested in fields like science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM), but also in arts, crafts, and DIY projects.
- **Skills**: Maker Spaces are designed to cater to a wide range of skill levels, from beginners to experienced makers. They provide resources for learning and improving skills in areas like electronics, 3D printing, 3D modeling, coding, robotics, and woodworking.
- **Goals**: Users of Maker Spaces often aim to learn new skills, work on personal projects, collaborate with others, or even develop business ideas.

# **Needs And Challenges**

## **Original Content**

```
### Needs and Challenges of Maker Space Users

1. **Cost**: Establishing and maintaining a Maker Space can involve significant costs. This includes the initial purchase of equipment, ongoing maintenance, replacement components, and consumable materials that require replenishing. Funding for these costs can come from a variety of sources, including grants, school budgets, foundational funding, and "friends of the library" groups. However, future funding must also be considered to keep a Maker Space running.

2. **Staffing and Scheduling**: Sufficiently staffing a Maker Space and providing programming can be challenging. Staff may need to balance managing both a library and a Maker Space, and scheduling activities and open "making time" can pose challenges.

3. **Staff and Patron Training**: Both librarian and patron training are necessary aspects of library Maker Spaces, yet these training opportunities are not always readily accessible. Staff may need to obtain training, keep abreast of new technologies and trends, and develop a professional learning network. Patrons also need training to ensure that equipment is accessed properly and safely.

4. **Neatness, Noise, and Maintenance**: Maker Spaces can invite "creative mess" and potentially damage existing furnishings. Noise from certain equipment may require added noise reduction features. The responsibility for the upkeep of the space, ensuring order, tidiness, and damage control, needs to be addressed.

5. **Safety and Liability**: Patron safety becomes a primary consideration when Maker Spaces provide potentially hazardous equipment. Safety protocols and user agreements are necessary to ensure safe conditions and protect the institution from liability.

6. **Copyright and Intellectual Property**: Issues such as copyright infringement, liability, and intellectual property can arise with the use of rapid prototyping such as 3D printing in Maker Spaces. Policies may need to be in place to ensure that patrons respect copyright law when creating products in the Maker Space.

7. **Resistance to Change**: Resistance to change can be a challenge when introducing a Maker Space. Staff and patrons may be hesitant to accept new directions in library programming. Effective change-management models and community support can help address this resistance.

# Financial Projections and Funding for a Maker Space

## 1. Financial Projections:

### Revenue Projections:

- **Memberships:** If we attract 100 members paying an average of $50 per month, we will generate $60,000 in annual membership revenue.
- **Workshops and Classes:** If we offer 10 workshops per month with an average of 10 participants paying $20 each, we will generate $24,000 in annual workshop revenue.
- **Equipment Rental:** If we generate an additional $500 per month in equipment rental fees, this will add $6,000 to our annual revenue.

This gives us a total projected annual revenue of $90,000.

### Expense Projections:

- **Rent:** If we pay $2,000 per month in rent, our annual rent expense will be $24,000.
- **Utilities and Maintenance:** If we spend an average of $500 per month on utilities and maintenance, our annual expense for this will be $6,000.
- **Salaries:** If we pay an average of $3,000 per month in salaries, our annual salary expense will be $36,000.
- **Equipment and Supplies:** If we spend an average of $1,000 per month on equipment and supplies, our annual expense for this will be $12,000.
- **Marketing:** If we spend an average of $200 per month on marketing, our annual marketing expense will be $2,400.

This gives us a total projected annual expense of $80,400.

Based on these projections, we would have a profit margin of approximately 10.7% and a positive cash flow.

## 2. Funding:

At this stage, we estimate that we will need approximately $50,000 in startup capital to cover the initial rent, equipment purchases, and marketing efforts. We plan to secure this funding through a combination of owner investment, business loans, and potentially grants or sponsorships.

Please note that these are rough estimates and the actual numbers will depend on a variety of factors, including the specific costs in your area, the number of members you attract, and the prices you charge for memberships and workshops.

# Risk Assessment and Mitigation for a Maker Space

## 1. Risk Assessment:

### Risk 1: Low Membership Numbers

If we are unable to attract enough members, we may not generate sufficient revenue to cover our expenses.

### Risk 2: Equipment Damage or Failure

Our Maker Space relies on various pieces of equipment, which could be damaged or fail, leading to costly repairs or replacements.

### Risk 3: Liability Issues

As a space where people are using potentially dangerous tools and equipment, there is a risk of accidents and injuries, which could lead to liability issues.

### Risk 4: Competition

Other Maker Spaces, community workshops, or educational institutions could provide competition, potentially drawing members away from our Maker Space.

## 2. Mitigation Strategies:

### Strategy 1: Diverse Revenue Streams

To mitigate the risk of low membership numbers, we will develop diverse revenue streams, such as workshops, classes, equipment rental, and partnerships with local schools or businesses.

### Strategy 2: Regular Maintenance and Insurance

To mitigate the risk of equipment damage or failure, we will conduct regular maintenance and inspections, and we will also insure our equipment against damage or loss.

### Strategy 3: Safety Protocols and Insurance

To mitigate liability issues, we will implement strict safety protocols, require all members to complete a safety orientation, and carry liability insurance.

### Strategy 4: Unique Selling Proposition and Community Engagement

To mitigate the risk of competition, we will focus on our unique selling proposition, such as our breadth of resources, community-centric approach, and focus on education. We will also engage with our community through events, partnerships, and social media.

## 3. Contingency Plans:

In the event of significant challenges or changes in circumstances, we have several contingency plans:

- **Plan 1:** If membership numbers are lower than expected, we could reduce our operating hours, offer more workshops or classes, or seek additional partnerships to generate more revenue.
- **Plan 2:** If a piece of equipment fails or is damaged, we could use our insurance to cover the cost of repairs or replacement, or we could seek to rent or borrow equipment as a temporary solution.
- **Plan 3:** If we face increased competition, we could focus on niche offerings, improve our marketing efforts, or seek to collaborate with our competitors to offer more value to our members.

By identifying these risks and developing strategies to mitigate them, we can be better prepared to handle any challenges that come our way.

# Financial Projections

Our financial projections are based on our pricing strategy, our target market, and our estimated operating costs.

## 1. Revenue Projections

- **Memberships:** If we attract 100 members paying an average of $50 per month, we will generate $60,000 in annual membership revenue.
- **Workshops and Classes:** If we offer 10 workshops per month with an average of 10 participants paying $20 each, we will generate $24,000 in annual workshop revenue.
- **Equipment Rental:** If we generate an additional $500 per month in equipment rental fees, this will add $6,000 to our annual revenue.

This gives us a total projected annual revenue of $90,000.

## 2. Expense Projections

- **Rent:** If we pay $2,000 per month in rent, our annual rent expense will be $24,000.
- **Utilities and Maintenance:** If we spend an average of $500 per month on utilities and maintenance, our annual expense for this will be $6,000.
- **Salaries:** If we pay an average of $3,000 per month in salaries, our annual salary expense will be $36,000.
- **Equipment and Supplies:** If we spend an average of $1,000 per month on equipment and supplies, our annual expense for this will be $12,000.
- **Marketing:** If we spend an average of $200 per month on marketing, our annual marketing expense will be $2,400.

This gives us a total projected annual expense of $80,400.

Based on these projections, we would have a profit margin of approximately 10.7% and a positive cash flow.

## 3. Funding Requirements

We estimate that we will need approximately $50,000 in startup capital to cover the initial rent, equipment purchases, and marketing efforts. We plan to secure this funding through a combination of owner investment, business loans, and potentially grants or sponsorships.

## 4. Return on Investment Analysis

Based on our financial projections, we expect to generate a profit in our first year of operation. This would provide a return on investment for any potential investors, as well as a sustainable source of income to support the ongoing operation of our Maker Space.

This Financial Projections section provides forecasts of revenue, expenses, profit margins, and cash flow for the Maker Space. It also outlines the business's funding requirements and provides a return on investment analysis for potential investors.

# Market Analysis

## Target Market

Our primary target market includes students, educators, entrepreneurs, hobbyists, and professionals. We aim to attract individuals interested in making, learning, and exploring, as well as those who need access to tools and resources for their projects or businesses.

## Market Size and Demographics

The Maker Movement has been growing steadily over the past decade, with an increasing number of individuals and organizations recognizing the value of hands-on, collaborative learning. According to a report by the Association for Creative Industries, the size of the creative industry in the U.S. was $43.9 billion in 2017, up 45% from 2011. This indicates a substantial potential market for our Maker Space.

Our target market is diverse, including individuals of all ages, backgrounds, and skill levels. We anticipate that our members will primarily be adults aged 18-45, with a roughly even split between males and females. However, we also aim to attract younger members through partnerships with local schools and youth organizations.

## Consumer Behaviors

Our target consumers value creativity, learning, and community. They are likely to be interested in technology, arts and crafts, DIY projects, and entrepreneurship. They may be looking for a space where they can work on their projects, learn new skills, and collaborate with others.

## Industry Trends

The Maker Movement is part of a larger trend towards hands-on, experiential learning. There is increasing recognition of the value of skills such as problem-solving, creativity, and collaboration, which are often developed through making and tinkering activities.

In addition, there is a growing interest in entrepreneurship and innovation, with more individuals looking to start their own businesses or develop their own products. Maker Spaces, with their access to tools and resources, can play a key role in supporting these entrepreneurial endeavors.

## Competitive Analysis

There are a few other Maker Spaces in our city, as well as several community workshops and educational institutions that offer similar resources. However, we believe that our focus on community, our wide range of resources, and our commitment to education set us apart from our competitors.

We will need to keep an eye on these competitors and continually strive to offer a unique, valuable service to our members. This may involve regularly updating our tools and resources, offering new workshops and classes, and seeking feedback from our members to ensure we are meeting their needs.

This Market Analysis provides a detailed overview of the target market, market size and demographics, consumer behaviors, industry trends, and competition for a Maker Space. It provides valuable insights that can inform the business's strategies and decisions.

# Risk Analysis and Contingency Plans

Every business faces potential risks and challenges. By identifying these risks and developing strategies to mitigate them, we can be better prepared to handle any challenges that come our way.

## 1. Risk Analysis

- **Low Membership Numbers:** If we are unable to attract enough members, we may not generate sufficient revenue to cover our expenses.
- **Equipment Damage or Failure:** Our Maker Space relies on various pieces of equipment, which could be damaged or fail, leading to costly repairs or replacements.
- **Liability Issues:** As a space where people are using potentially dangerous tools and equipment, there is a risk of accidents and injuries, which could lead to liability issues.
- **Competition:** Other Maker Spaces, community workshops, or educational institutions could provide competition, potentially drawing members away from our Maker Space.

## 2. Mitigation Strategies

- **Diverse Revenue Streams:** To mitigate the risk of low membership numbers, we will develop diverse revenue streams, such as workshops, classes, equipment rental, and partnerships with local schools or businesses.
- **Regular Maintenance and Insurance:** To mitigate the risk of equipment damage or failure, we will conduct regular maintenance and inspections, and we will also insure our equipment against damage or loss.
- **Safety Protocols and Insurance:** To mitigate liability issues, we will implement strict safety protocols, require all members to complete a safety orientation, and carry liability insurance.
- **Unique Selling Proposition and Community Engagement:** To mitigate the risk of competition, we will focus on our unique selling proposition, such as our breadth of resources, community-centric approach, and focus on education. We will also engage with our community through events, partnerships, and social media.

## 3. Contingency Plans

In the event of significant challenges or changes in circumstances, we have several contingency plans:

- **Plan 1:** If membership numbers are lower than expected, we could reduce our operating hours, offer more workshops or classes, or seek additional partnerships to generate more revenue.
- **Plan 2:** If a piece of equipment fails or is damaged, we could use our insurance to cover the cost of repairs or replacement, or we could seek to rent or borrow equipment as a temporary solution.
- **Plan 3:** If we face increased competition, we could focus on niche offerings, improve our marketing efforts, or seek to collaborate with our competitors to offer more value to our members.

Remember, a business plan is a living document and should be updated regularly as your business grows and changes. By regularly reviewing and updating our risk analysis and contingency plans, we can ensure that we are prepared for any challenges that may arise.

This Risk Analysis and Contingency Plans section provides an assessment of potential risks and challenges that could impact the Maker Space, along with strategies to mitigate these risks. It also outlines contingency plans in case things don't go as planned. The reminder at the end emphasizes the importance of regularly updating the business plan as the business grows and changes.

# Chapter 1: Understanding Maker Spaces

## 1.1 What is a Maker Space?

A maker space is a collaborative workspace where individuals come together to create, tinker, invent, and learn through hands-on activities. It provides access to various tools, equipment, and resources that enable people to bring their ideas to life. Maker spaces are typically open to people of all ages and backgrounds, fostering a community of makers who share knowledge and skills.

Maker spaces can be found in schools, universities, libraries, community centers, and independent organizations. They often have a do-it-yourself (DIY) ethos, encouraging participants to explore technology, craftsmanship, and artistic expression. These spaces are designed to promote creativity, innovation, and problem-solving by offering a supportive environment for experimentation and collaboration.

## 1.2 Benefits of a Maker Space

There are several benefits associated with maker spaces:

### 1.2.1 Hands-on Learning

Maker spaces provide a hands-on learning experience, allowing individuals to engage with tools and technologies in a practical way. This experiential learning approach enhances understanding and retention of knowledge, particularly in areas such as science, technology, engineering, art, and mathematics (STEAM).

### 1.2.2 Creativity and Innovation

Maker spaces inspire creativity and innovation by providing a diverse range of materials and resources. Makers can explore new ideas, experiment with different techniques, and develop unique solutions to problems. This fosters a mindset of innovation and encourages out-of-the-box thinking.

### 1.2.3 Skill Development

Maker spaces offer opportunities for skill development across various domains. Participants can acquire technical skills related to electronics, coding, woodworking, 3D printing, robotics, and more. Additionally, they can develop critical thinking, problem-solving, teamwork, and communication skills through collaborative projects.

### 1.2.4 Accessible Tools and Equipment

Maker spaces provide access to tools and equipment that may be expensive or difficult to obtain individually.

- Collaborative Projects: Collaborate with other maker spaces, educational institutions, or organizations to work on joint projects or initiatives. Pool resources, share expertise, and create opportunities for cross-pollination of ideas and knowledge.

- Professional Development: Offer professional development programs for educators, professionals, or individuals interested in maker education. Develop partnerships with schools or companies to deliver specialized training or certification programs.

- Satellite Spaces: Consider establishing satellite maker spaces in different locations to expand your reach and serve communities that may not have easy access to your main space. Collaborate with local partners or institutions to set up and manage these satellite spaces.

- Mobile Maker Spaces: Create mobile maker spaces that can travel to schools, community events, or underserved areas. Customize a vehicle or trailer with essential tools and equipment, and bring making opportunities directly to different communities.

## 9.3 Monitoring Key Performance Indicators

Monitoring key performance indicators (KPIs) is crucial to assess the success and growth of your maker space. Consider the following KPIs:

- Membership Growth: Track the growth rate of your membership base. Monitor the number of new members, retention rates, and member feedback to gauge the satisfaction and value your maker space provides.

- Workshop Attendance: Monitor workshop attendance to assess the popularity and demand for different programs. Identify trends and adjust your program schedule to align with participants' interests.

- Revenue and Expenses: Continuously monitor your financial performance. Track revenue streams, operating expenses, and profitability to ensure financial sustainability. Regularly review your budget and make necessary adjustments.

- Community Impact: Evaluate the impact your maker space has on the community. Measure the number of community collaborations, partnerships formed, outreach programs conducted, and the feedback received from community members.

## 9.4 Adapting to Changing Needs and Technologies

Adapting to changing needs and technologies is essential to stay relevant and innovative. Consider the following strategies:

- Stay Informed: Stay updated with the latest trends, technologies, and advancements in the maker and STEAM fields. Attend conferences, workshops, and webinars. Engage with maker communities and professional networks to learn from others and share knowledge.

- Equipment Upgrades: Regularly evaluate your tools and equipment to ensure they align with current industry standards and user needs. Budget for equipment upgrades or additions to meet evolving demands.

- Program Diversification: Continuously diversify your program offerings to cater to changing interests and emerging technologies. Introduce new workshops, classes, or projects that align with participants' evolving needs and passions.

- Flexibility in Spaces: Design your maker space with flexibility in mind. Create modular or adaptable spaces that can accommodate different types of projects, technologies, or events. This allows you to easily reconfigure the space as needed.

By focusing on fundraising and revenue generation, exploring collaboration and expansion opportunities, monitoring key performance indicators, and adapting to changing needs and technologies, you can ensure the sustainability and growth of your maker space in the long run.
